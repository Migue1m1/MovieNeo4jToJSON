The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screen-writing ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman\u0027s Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and debuted as a director with Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed The Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer Gale Anne Hurd, who produced several of his films. He married Kathryn Bigelow in 1989.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJean-Pierre Jeunet is a French film director and screenwriter known for the films Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children, Alien: Resurrection and Amélie.Jean-Pierre Jeunet was born in Roanne, Loire, France. He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at Cinémation Studios. He befriended Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director. They met at an animation festival in Annecy in 1974.Together, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean Michel Jarre\u0027s Zoolook (together with Caro).Jeunet\u0027s films often resonate with the late twentieth century French film movement, cinéma du look, and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.Jeunet and Caro\u0027s first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.They next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children\u0027s dreams so that he can live indefinitely.[3] The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.Jeunet directed Amélie (2001), starring Audrey Tautou. Amélie is the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this film, Jeunet also gained a European Film Award for Best Director.Jeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2\u002725\" film for Chanel N° 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.Description above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Pierre Jeunet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Stanley Kubrick (July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an American film director, writer, producer, and photographer who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He maintained almost complete artistic control, making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-studio financial support for all his endeavors. Kubrick\u0027s films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detail—his later films often have elements of surrealism and expressionism that eschews structured linear narrative. His films are repeatedly described as slow and methodical, and are often perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. A recurring theme in his films is man\u0027s inhumanity to man. While often viewed as expressing an ironic pessimism, a few critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully.The film that first brought him attention to many critics was Paths of Glory, the first of three films of his about the dehumanizing effects of war. Many of his films at first got a lukewarm reception, only to be years later acclaimed as masterpieces that had a seminal influence on many later generations of film-makers. Considered especially groundbreaking was 2001: A Space Odyssey noted for being both one of the most scientifically realistic and visually innovative science-fiction films ever made while maintaining an enigmatic non-linear storyline. He voluntarily withdrew his film A Clockwork Orange from England, after it was accused of inspiring copycat crimes which in turn resulted in threats against Kubrick\u0027s family. His films were largely successful at the box-office, although Barry Lyndon performed poorly in the United States. Living authors Anthony Burgess and Stephen King were both unhappy with Kubrick\u0027s adaptations of their novels A Clockwork Orange and The Shining respectively, and both authors were engaged with subsequent adaptations. All of Kubrick\u0027s films from the mid-1950s to his death except for The Shining were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTAs. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey.Even though all of his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works have been described by Jason Ankeny and others as \"original and visionary\". Although some critics, notably Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, frequently disparaged Kubrick\u0027s work, Ankeny describes Kubrick as one of the most \"universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era\" with a \"standing unique among the filmmakers of his day.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Stanley Kubrick, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The monumental success of \"Star Wars\" (1977) ushered in the era of the \"summer blockbuster,\" which, despite the later popularity of low budget independent films, was still the prevailing mentality powering the Hollywood engine.Though he set the tone and established the expectations which influenced studios to devote the bulk of their resources to films designed to blast off into hyperspace for spectacular profits, it was doubtful that a film as revolutionary as \"Star Wars\" was in its day could get made in the later blockbuster assembly line climate of the new millennium.",

Nimoy\u0027s most famous role is that of Spock in the original Star Trek series 1966–1969, multiple films, television and video game sequels.Nimoy began his career in his early twenties, teaching acting classes in Hollywood and making minor film and television appearances through the 1950s, as well as playing the title role in Kid Monk Baroni. In 1953, he served in the United States Army. In 1965, he made his first appearance in the rejected Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage\", and would go on to play the character of Mr. Spock until 1969, followed by seven further films and a number of guest slots in various sequels. His character of Spock generated a significant cultural impact and three Emmy Award nominations; TV Guide named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. Nimoy also had a recurring role in Mission: Impossible and a narrating role in Civilization IV, as well as several well-received stage appearances. Nimoy\u0027s fame as Spock is such that both his autobiographies, I Am Not Spock (1977) and I Am Spock (1995) detail his existence as being shared between the character and himself.Nimoy was born to Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, Ukraine. His father, Max Nimoy, owned a barbershop in the Mattapan section of the city. His mother, Dora Nimoy (née Spinner), was a homemaker. Nimoy began acting at the age of eight in children\u0027s and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion—which, his father advised, Nimoy could always make a living with—but his grandfather encouraged him to become an actor. His first major role was at 17, as Ralphie in an amateur production of Clifford Odets\u0027 Awake and Sing!. Nimoy took Drama classes at Boston College in 1953 but failed to complete his studies, and in the 1970s studied photography at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has an MA in Education and an honorary doctorate from Antioch University in Ohio. Nimoy served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army from 1953 through 1955, alongside fellow actor Ken Berry and architect Frank Gehry.",

He won Academy Awards as Best Director for The Sound of Music (1965) and West Side Story (1961) as well as nominations as Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941) and Best Picture for The Sand Pebbles (1966).Among his other films are Born to Kill; Destination Gobi; The Hindenburg; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; The Day the Earth Stood Still; Run Silent, Run Deep; The Andromeda Strain; The Set-Up; The Haunting; and The Body Snatcher. Wise\u0027s working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.Often contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story to dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise\u0027s notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise\u0027s approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from horror to noir to Western to war films to science fiction, to musical and drama, with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise\u0027s tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many Academy Award-winning films the result.

His siblings are Janine, Claire, Diane and Steven. His father was of Polish descent and worked as a nuclear physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1967 the Verbinski family moved to Southern California, where a young Gregor grew up in the town of La Jolla.Gregor was an active Boy Scout and surfed regularly. He went to Torrey Pines Elementary, Muirlands Junior High, and La Jolla High School before attending UCLA Film School. Verbinski graduated with his BFA in Film from UCLA in 1987.Verbinski was active in several L.A. rock bands early in his career. His first band was Thelonius Monster, which included drummer Danny Heifetz. He also played in the Daredevils, Bulldozer, The Drivers, and the all-star band The Cylon Boys Choir.He was also in a band called The Little Kings, which backed Stiv Bators on his version of \"Have Love Will Travel\". Along with a cover of the Moody Blues song \"The Story in Your Eyes\" (by other musicians), the song was released by Bators in the Fall of 1986 as a 12-inch single on Bomp! (catalogue #12136) and was later included in Bators\u0027 compilation album L.A. L.A. On the compilation album\u0027s liner notes, label owner Greg Shaw described the band as \"an adequate but rootless Hollywood glam-damaged band with tattoos\".His first films were a series of 8 mm films called \"The Driver Files\" circa 1979, when he was a young teen. Although most associate Verbinski with feature films, he started his career directing music videos for bands like Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster Magnet working at Palomar Pictures. This was not surprising to his friends in Los Angeles, since he had been in various punk and rock bands; the Daredevils, for instance, included then-departed member of Bad Religion Brett Gurewitz.Verbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of his most famous commercials was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials, Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion.After completing a short film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature film directing debut with his comedy flick, Mouse Hunt. The film was a hit globally and he soon followed up the success with the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The Ring (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in The Time Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon Wells. Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences and is given a Thanks to credit in the film.He then directed the very successful Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which earned over $600 million at the international box office.His next film was The Weather Man which starred Nicolas Cage.

        "biography": "George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985), best known as Orson Welles, was an American film director, actor, theatre director, screenwriter, and producer, who worked extensively in film, theatre, television and radio. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work—despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. Welles\u0027s long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"After directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells\u0027s novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated,[2] they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.Citizen Kane (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965), and F for Fake (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI\u0027s 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.Description above from the Wikipedia article Orson Welles, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is widely acclaimed as one of Hollywood\u0027s most celebrated and influential film directors. He epitomized the group of filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Woody Allen and William Friedkin, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking.He co-authored the script for Patton, winning the Academy Award in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d\u0027Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. His next directorial venture was Apocalypse Now in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War. It won his second Palme d\u0027Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.Although some of Coppola\u0027s ventures in the 1980s and early 1990s were critically lauded, Coppola\u0027s later work has not met the same level of critical and commercial success as his \u002770s films.

        "biography": "Dennis Lee Hopper (May 17, 1936 – May 29, 2010) was an American actor, filmmaker and artist. As a young man, Hopper became interested in acting and eventually became a student of the Actors\u0027 Studio. He made his first television appearance in 1954, and appeared in two films featuring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). During the next 10 years, Hopper appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and by the end of the 1960s had played supporting roles in several films. He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention. He subsequently appeared in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Osterman Weekend (1983), and received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He directed Colors (1988) and played the villain in Speed (1994). Hopper\u0027s later work included a leading role in the television series Crash. Hopper\u0027s last performance was filmed just before his death: The Last Film Festival, slated for a 2011 release. Hopper was also a prolific and acclaimed photographer, a profession he began in the 1960s.Description above from the Wikipedia article Dennis Hopper, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Following his breakthrough role on the TV series Rawhide (1959–65), Eastwood starred as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone\u0027s Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films (Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact, and The Dead Pool) during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work in the films Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including Play Misty for Me (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985), In the Line of Fire (1993), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and Gran Torino (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim. Eastwood\u0027s only comedies have been Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980); despite being widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting for inflation.Eastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as Mystic River (2003) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and Changeling (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was awarded two of France\u0027s highest honors: in 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded the Légion d\u0027honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.Since 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married twice. An audiophile, Eastwood is also associated with jazz and has composed and performed pieces in several films along with his eldest son, Kyle Eastwood.Description above from the Wikipedia article Clint Eastwood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Harris and Rees-Willams divorced in 1969, and then Elizabeth married another well-known actor, Sir Rex Harrison. Harris\u0027 second marriage was to the American actress Ann Turkel, who was 16 years younger than he, and this marriage also ended in a divorce.Despite his divorces, Harris was a member of the Roman Catholic Knights of Malta, and was also dubbed a knight by the Queen of Denmark in 1985. Harris was a life long friend of actor Peter O\u0027Toole. Harris died of Hodgkin\u0027s disease on 25 October 2002, aged 72, two and a half weeks before the American premiere of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was replaced as Dumbledore by the Irish-born actor Sir Michael Gambon. For years, whenever he was in London, Harris resided at the Savoy Hotel. According to the hotel archivist Susan Scott, as Harris was being taken from the hotel on a stretcher, shortly before his death, he warned the diners, \"It was the food!\" Harris\u0027s remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered in The Bahamas Islands, where he had owned a home.",

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley\u0027s older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.At the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film\u0027s main visual elements would become features of Scott\u0027s later work; it was issued on the \u0027Extras\u0027 section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.He was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.At the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!In 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.In 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.  ",

Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki\u0027s films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.Miyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver\u0027s Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie\u0027s ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.While Miyazaki\u0027s films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic\u0027s sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.Miyazaki\u0027s films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity\u0027s relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki\u0027s feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.",

His first pictur e—made in the silent era— was called \"the most famous short film ever made\" by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film —made 48 years later— won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel\u0027s work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality... scandalous and subversive\".Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films\".Six of Buñuel\u0027s films are included in Sight \u0026 Sound\u0027s 2012 critics\u0027 poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don\u0027t They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with John Ford for second most, and he ranks number 14 on their list of the top 250 directors.",

He won the Best Actor Award at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival.Trintignant was born in Piolenc, Vaucluse, France, the son of Claire (née Tourtin) and Raoul Trintignant, an industrialist. At the age of twenty, Trintignant moved to Paris to study drama, and made his theatrical debut in 1951 going on to be seen as one of the most gifted French actors of the post-war era. After touring in the early 1950s in several theater productions, his first motion picture appearance came in 1955 and the following year he gained stardom with his performance opposite Brigitte Bardot in Roger Vadim\u0027s And God Created Woman.Trintignant’s acting was interrupted for several years by mandatory military service. After serving in Algiers, he returned to Paris and resumed his work in film. He had the leading male role in the classic A Man and a Woman, which at the time was the most successful French film ever screened in the foreign market.In Italy, he was always dubbed into Italian, and his work stretched into collaborations with renowned Italian directors, including Sergio Corbucci in The Great Silence, Valerio Zurlini in Violent Summer and The Desert of the Tartars, Ettore Scola in La terrazza, Bernardo Bertolucci in The Conformist, and Dino Risi in the cult film The Easy Life.Throughout the 1970s, Trintignant starred in numerous films and in 1983 he made his first English language feature film, Under Fire. Following this, he starred in François Truffaut\u0027s final film, Confidentially Yours, and reprised his best-known role in the sequel A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later.In 1994, he starred in Krzysztof Kieślowski\u0027s last film, Three Colors: Red.Though he takes an occasional film role, he has, as of late, been focusing essentially on his stage work.After a 14-year gap, Trintignant came back on screen for Michael Haneke\u0027s film Amour. Haneke had sent Trintignant the script, which had been written specifically for him. Trintignant said that he chooses which films he works in on the basis of the director, and said of Haneke that \"he has the most complete mastery of the cinematic discipline, from technical aspects like sound and photography to the way he handles actors\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Louis Trintignant, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

In the 1970s, he established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions. Between 1972 and 1992, he directed nine theatrically released feature films, five of which he wrote. He has been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator.Beginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to director. He moved to the animation division of Paramount Pictures in 1967 and started his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in 1968. Through producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi made his debut feature film, Fritz the Cat, released in 1972. It was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, and the most successful independent animated feature of all time.Over the next eleven years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. He is well known for his fantasy films, which include Wizards (1977), The Lord of the Rings (1978) and Fire and Ice (1983). In 1987, Bakshi returned to television work, producing the series Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, which ran for two years before it was canceled due to complaints from a conservative political group over perceived drug references. After a nine-year hiatus from feature films, he directed Cool World (1992), which was largely rewritten during production and received poor reviews. Bakshi returned to television with the live-action film Cool and the Crazy (1994) and the anthology series Spicy City (1997).He founded the Bakshi School of Animation and Cartooning in 2003. During the 2000s, he has focused largely on painting. He has received several awards for his work, including the 1980 Golden Gryphon for The Lord of the Rings at the Giffoni Film Festival, the 1988 Annie Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation, and the 2003 Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest Film Festival.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ralph Bakshi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He won a scholarship to the University of Southern California to study at the USC School of Cinema-Television. He made two short films at USC, The Goodbye Place and Visceral Matter, before graduating in 1997.Donnie Darko was his first feature and was nominated for 21 small awards, winning 11 of them, including a nomination for a Saturn Award. The film later ended up #2 on Empire magazine\u0027s list of 50 greatest independent films of all time, behind Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Reservoir Dogs.Although Kelly\u0027s films differ considerably in setting and characters (Donnie Darko is about a suburban teenager, Southland Tales is an L.A. epic, and The Box is about a married couple in Richmond, Virginia), they share similar themes of time travel, existentialism, and spirituality.Kelly\u0027s enthusiasm and direction can be traced back to his viewing of the film Brazil, as told to author Robert K. Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life.In 2016, filmmaker Kevin Smith said of Kelly: \"He is insanely creative and is not unlike Christopher Nolan. But Nolan wound up in the Warner Bros. system where he got special handling, and he got a lot of money to make huge art films like Inception. Richard can be one of our greatest filmmakers.

Often thought of as primarily a director of comedies, he was also renowned for his dramatic work, Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027s and Days of Wine and Roses. His greatest successes, however, were his comedies, and most of his films were either musicals, melodramas, slapstick comedies, and thrillers.In 2004, he received an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of his writing, directing and producing an extraordinary body of work for the screen.Description above from the Wikipedia article Blake Edwards, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

Fleischer (December 8, 1916 – March 25, 2006) was an American film director.Fleischer was born in Brooklyn, the son of Essie (née Goldstein) and animator/producer Max Fleischer. After graduating from Brown University, he went to Yale School of Drama, where he met his future wife, Mary Dickson.His film career began in 1942 at the RKO studio, directing shorts, documentaries, and compilations of forgotten silent features.Fleischer moved to Los Angeles and was assigned his first feature, Child of Divorce (1946).In 1954, he was chosen by Walt Disney (his father\u0027s former rival as a cartoon producer) to direct 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea starring Kirk Douglas.In 1955 Fox signed Fleischer to a long term contract. He would work for that studio for the next fifteen years. His first film under his new contract with Fox was The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Kirk Douglas hired Fleischer to make The Vikings (1958), which was another big hit.He then moved to Paris where he directed two stories for Darryl F. Zanuck starring Greco. Fleischer then signed a contract with Dino de Laurentiis to make Barabbas (1962).Back in Hollywood, Richard Zanuck had become head of production at Fox and offered Fleischer Fantastic Voyage (1966). It was a success and resurrected his Hollywood career.Che! (1969), a biopic of Che Guevera that starred Omar Sharif, was an expensive flop, as was an account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). This was his last film for 20th Century Fox.Fleischer travelled to England, where he directed an acclaimed thriller, 10 Rillington Place. See No Evil (1971) with Mia Farrow was another thriller. In Hollywood, he made The New Centurions (1972). At MGM, he made a science-fiction film, Soylent Green (1973), with Charlton Heston.He was reunited with De Laurentiis for the popular, if controversial, Mandingo (1975).The Prince and the Pauper (1977) was a version of the Mark Twain novel that featured Heston, Harrison and Scott in its cast. Fleischer was then hired on Ashanti (1979), starring Michael Caine, which turned out to be a flop.Tough Enough (1983) was about the Toughman Contest starring Dennis Quaid. He made three more for de Laurentiis. His final theatrical feature was Million Dollar Mystery (1987).Fleischer was chairman of Fleischer Studios, which today handles the licensing of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown. In June 2005, he released his memoirs of his father\u0027s career in Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution.Fleischer\u0027s 1993 autobiography, Just Tell Me When to Cry, described his many difficulties with actors, writers and producers.Description above from the Wikipedia article Richard O.

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques, which are critically recognized to be among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot\u0027s wife Véra died of a heart attack and Clouzot\u0027s career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot\u0027s career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.Description above from the Wikipedia article Henri-Georges Clouzot, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a British subject.Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person\u0027s gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside \"icy blonde\" female characters. Many of Hitchcock\u0027s films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or \"MacGuffins\" meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock\u0027s films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon.Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain\u0027s Daily Telegraph, which said: \"Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.\" The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema\u0027s most significant artists.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alfred Hitchcock, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In a professional career that lasted less than fifteen years, he completed forty feature length films; two television film series; three short films; four video productions; twenty-four stage plays and four radio plays; and thirty-six acting roles in his own and others’ films. He also worked as an actor (film and theater), author, cameraman, composer, designer, editor, producer and theater manager.Underlying Fassbinder\u0027s work was a desire to provoke and disturb. His phenomenal creative energy, when working, coexisted with a wild, self-destructive libertinism that earned him a reputation as the enfant terrible of the New German Cinema, as well as being its central figure. He had tortured personal relationships with the actors and technicians around him who formed a surrogate family. However, his pictures demonstrate his deep sensitivity to social outsiders and his hatred of institutionalized violence. He ruthlessly attacked both German bourgeois society and the larger limitations of humanity.Fassbinder died in June 1982 at the age of 37 from a lethal cocktail of cocaine and barbiturates. His death has often been cited as the event that ended the New German Cinema movement.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Elia Kazan ( September 7 , 1909, Kayseri – September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director and actor, described as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\". He also produced, and wrote screenplays and novels. Born in the Kayseri, Ottoman Empire to Greek parents, they emigrated to New York when he was four. After two years studying acting at Yale, he acted professionally for eight years before becoming a stage and film director. Kazan co-founded the influential Group Theater in 1932 and Actors Studio in 1947, and together with Lee Strasberg, introduced Method acting to the American stage and cinema as a new form of self-expression and psychological \"realism\". Having been an actor himself for eight years, he brought sensitivity and understanding of the acting process, and was later considered the ideal \"actor\u0027s director\". He himself acted in only a few films, including City for Conquest (1940), alongside James Cagney.Kazan introduced a new generation of unknown young actors to the movie audiences, including Marlon Brando and James Dean, but was most noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors. As a result, he directed 21 different actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He became \"one of the consummate filmmakers of the 20th century\", after directing a continual string of successful films, including, A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and East of Eden. During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director and received an Honorary Oscar, won three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. Among the other new actors he introduced to movie audiences for the first time, were Warren Beatty, Carroll Baker, Julie Harris, Andy Griffith, Lee Remick, Rip Torn, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Martin Balsam, Fred Gwynne, and Pat Hingle. He also elicited some of the best performances in the careers of actors like Natalie Wood and James Dunn. Producer George Stevens, Jr. concludes that Kazan\u0027s films and new actors have \"changed American moviemaking\".Most of his films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don\u0027t move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life.\" His first such \"issue\" film was Gentleman\u0027s Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with hidden anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, and Kazan\u0027s first for Best Director. It was followed by Pinky, one of the first films to address racial prejudice against blacks. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, a film about union corruption in New York, which some consider \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\" A major film earlier in his career was A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed. It received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando\u0027s breakthrough role, although his screen debut was the previous year, 1950, playing a paraplegic war veteran in \u0027The Men\u0027. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck\u0027s East of Eden, which also introduced James Dean to movie audiences for the first time, making him an overnight star.A turning point in Kazan\u0027s career came with his testimony as a \"friendly witness\" before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952, which cost him the respect of many liberal friends and colleagues, such as playwright Arthur Miller. Kazan later explains that he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong\". Overall, Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s by his run of provocative, issues-driven subjects, and acting. Moreover, his personal brand of cinema, employing real locations over sets, unknowns over stars, and realism over convenient genres, proved influential to a whole generation of independent filmmakers in the 1960s, such as Sidney Lumet, John Cassavetes, Arthur Penn, Woody Allen, and Martin Scorsese. Film author Ian Freer concludes that \"If his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood — and actors everywhere — owes him, is enormous.\" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film, A Letter to Elia, as a personal tribute to Kazan, who he credits as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker.Description above from the Wikipedia article Elia Kazan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Walter Ruttmann was a German film director and along with Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling and Oskar Fischinger was an early German practitioner of experimental film. Ruttmann was born in Frankfurt am Main; His film career began in the early 1920s. His first abstract short films, Lichtspiel: Opus I (1921) and Opus II (1923), were experiments with new forms of film expression. Ruttmann and his colleagues of the avant garde movement enriched the language of film as a medium with new formal techniques.Ruttmann was a prominent exponent of both avant-garde art and music. His early abstractions played at the 1929 Baden-Baden Festival to international acclaim despite their being almost eight years old. Ruttmann licensed a Wax Slicing machine from Oskar Fischinger to create special effects for Lotte Reiniger. Together with Erwin Piscator, he worked on the film Melody of the World (1929), though he is best remembered for Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, 1927).During the Nazi period he worked as an assistant to director Leni Riefenstahl on Triumph of the Will (1935). He died in Berlin of wounds sustained when he was working on the front line as a war photographer.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.James Whale (22 July 1889 – 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theatre director and actor. He is best remembered for his work in the horror film genre, having directed Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), all recognized as classics of the genre. Whale directed over a dozen films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.Born into a large family in Dudley, England, Whale early discovered his artistic talent and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I, Whale enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey\u0027s End led to his move to the United States, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood to direct motion pictures. Whale lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Including Journey\u0027s End (1930), Whale directed a dozen films for Universal Studios between 1930 and 1936 (his uncredited work on the war epic Hell\u0027s Angels having been done for United Artists), developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.At the height of his popularity as a director, Whale directed The Road Back, a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front, in 1937. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film\u0027s being altered from Whale\u0027s vision and The Road Back was a critical and commercial failure. A string of commercial failures followed and, while Whale would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. Whale continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. Whale committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his backyard swimming pool.Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that Whale\u0027s refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career. However, Whale\u0027s associates dismiss the notions that Whale\u0027s sexuality informed his work or that it cost him his career.Description above from the Wikipedia article James Whale, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

According to film historian James Welsh, his candid treatment of adult relationships in Henry \u0026amp; June was considered an “artistic breakthrough by an unconventional filmmaker who was willing to take a chance and put his career on the line.”His greatest success was the blockbuster film The Right Stuff, where he directed and wrote the screenplay.

Keaton made her film debut in the 1972 screen adaptation of Woody Allen’s Broadway play \"Play It Again, Sam\". That same year Keaton was cast in her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Oscar-winning movie “The Godfather”. Keaton established herself as a comic actor in her next two films “Sleeper” (1973) and “Love and Death” (1975).In 1977, Keaton veered away from her comedic image to appear in the remarkable “Looking for Mr. Goodbar”, which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was that same year that she appeared in the title role of “Annie Hall”, which many consider to be her best performance. The following year Keaton was awarded the Oscar for best actress in a leading role, as well as the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Film Award. In the early 1990’s Keaton began to play more mature roles, though she reprised the role of Kay Adams-Corleone in the third \"Godfather\" epic, The Godfather: Part III (1990). She appeared in the well-liked  “Father of the Bride” (1991) and “Father of the Bride Part II” (1995) as “Nina Banks” the wife of “George Banks” played by Steve Martin. Some of her popular later films include: The First Wives Club (1996), Something\u0027s Gotta Give (2003) and The Family Stone (2005). In addition to acting, she is also a director, producer, screenwriter, photographer, real estate developer, and occasional singer. Her first record was an original cast recording of Hair, in 1971. In 1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished product was never seen. In 1995 she received high marks for Unstrung Heroes (1995), her first major feature as a director. Keaton was romantically involved with several other celebrities such as Warren Beatty, Al Pacino and her most famous romance - Woody Allen. In 2001 Keaton publicly announced that she was giving up on pursuing romance and later adopted two children, a daughter, Dexter (adopted 1996), and a son, Duke (adopted 2001). ",

        "biography": "Takeshi Kitano (born January 18, 1947) is a Japanese filmmaker, comedian, singer, actor, tap dancer, film editor, presenter, screenwriter, author, poet, painter, and one-time video game designer who has received critical acclaim, both in his native Japan and abroad, for his highly idiosyncratic cinematic work. The famed Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa once dubbed him \"the true successor\" to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. With the exception of his works as a film director, he is known almost exclusively by the name Beat Takeshi. Since April 2005, he has been a professor at the Graduate School of Visual Arts, Tokyo University of the Arts. Kitano owns his own talent agency and production company, Office Kitano, which launched Tokyo Filmex in 2000. Some of Kitano\u0027s earlier films are dramas about Yakuza gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes where nothing appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak or nihilistic philosophy, but they are also filled with a great deal of humor and affection for their characters. Kitano\u0027s films leave paradoxical impressions and can seem controversial. While formally disguised as dark comedies or gangster movies, his films raise moral questions and provide food for thought. The Japanese public knows him primarily as a TV host and comedian, and he is well remembered for the leading role of the comedy show Oretachi Hyōkin-zoku (1981–1989) and for the game show Takeshi\u0027s Castle (1986–1989). His portrayal of Zatōichi in the 2003 movie is his biggest domestic commercial success. He hosts a weekly television program called Beat Takeshi\u0027s TV Tackle, a kind of panel discussion among entertainers and politicians regarding controversial current events. In 2010 the Fondation Cartier pour l\u0027art contemporain in Paris held a one-man show displaying his paintings and installations. A room in the basement played a 12-hour loop of his work as a TV host.",

        "biography": "Roman Polanski (born 18 August 1933) is a Polish-French film director, producer, writer and actor. Born in Paris to Polish parents, Polanski relocated with his family to Poland in 1937. After surviving the Holocaust, he continued his education in Poland and became a critically acclaimed director of both art house and commercial films. Polanski\u0027s first feature-length film, Knife in the Water (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, and in 2002 received the Academy Award for Best Director for his film, The Pianist. He has also been the recipient of two Baftas, four Césars, a Golden Globe and the Palme d\u0027Or. He left Poland in 1961 to live in France for several years, then moved to the United Kingdom where he collaborated with Gérard Brach on three films, beginning with Repulsion (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film Rosemary\u0027s Baby.In 1969, Polanski\u0027s pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while staying at the Polanski\u0027s Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles by members of the Manson Family. Following Tate\u0027s death, Polanski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not make another film until he filmed Macbeth (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make What? (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he traveled to Hollywood to direct Chinatown (1974) for Paramount Pictures, with Robert Evans serving as producer. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success; the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Polanski\u0027s next film, The Tenant (1976), was shot in France, and completed the \"Apartment Trilogy\", following Repulsion and Rosemary\u0027s Baby.In 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Polanski was arrested for the sexual abuse of a 13 year old girl. He was charged with rape but pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Polanski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. He has had a U.S. arrest warrant outstanding since then, and an international arrest warrant since 2005.Polanski continued to make films such as The Pianist (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman\u0027s autobiography of the same name, which echoed some of Polanski\u0027s earlier life experiences. Like Szpilman, Polanski escaped the ghetto and the concentration camps while family members were killed. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, the Cannes Film Festival\u0027s Palme d\u0027Or, and seven French César Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. He then released the successful films Oliver Twist (2005), To Each His Own Cinema (2007), and The Ghost Writer (2010), completed while under house arrest.In September 2009, Polanski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich Film Festival.In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a \"free man\" after releasing him from custody.",

He was also among the postwar writer-directors who made some of their best films as they struggled to break free of industry censorship.

A bout de souffle (Breathless) (1959) was his first feature. Made on a shoe-string budget, it was spontaneous, vibrant and ground breakingly original. From then until 1967/8 was loosely his first period when he made an astonishing number of films, sometimes 3 a year. From 68 Godard was very involved in political film-making, and then made a series of programmes for French TV in the mid and late 70’s. With Sauve qui peut (la vie) or Slow Motion, Godard could be said to start a 3rd period through the 80’s. In the 90’s he started more formal experimentation, specifically with his long series Histoire(s) du Cinéma. His films have influenced film-makers as diverse as Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch, Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino and Wong Kar-Wai. His latest film, Film Socialisme, received its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard) to great acclaim. Jean-Luc Godard was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2010.",

Lemmons was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of a poet/psychotherapist mother and a biology teacher father.  When Lemmons was eight years old, her parents divorced, and she and her mother and two sisters moved to Newton, Massachusetts. Her mother remarried when she was nine. Her passion for movies came at an early age, but becoming a director was her goal. \"I wanted to do something more meaningful than going to auditions…\"Lemmons is married to actor and director Vondie Curtis-Hall. They have a son, Henry Hunter (born 1996), and a daughter, Zora (1999). Lemmons states that her husband is immensely supportive and feels that he is more relaxed than she is. Compared to how he works, she prefers the pressure of working on a set with the actors. As a director and a mother, Lemmons says that it gives her perspective. Her life outside of the movie set and Hollywood has kept her grounded. Though she is a Black woman, Lemmons identifies herself as an artist first and foremost in her career. \"…I don’t wake up every day saying I’m a Black woman because it’s too given, but I wake up every day feeling like an artist and I feel I’m an artist.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Kasi Lemmons, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Thomas Vinterberg (born 19 May 1969) is a Danish film director who, along with Lars von Trier, co-founded the Dogme 95 movement in filmmaking, which established rules for simplifying movie production. He is best known for the films The Celebration (1998), Submarino (2010), The Hunt (2012) and Far from the Madding Crowd (2015).Vinterberg was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. In 1993, he graduated from the National Film School of Denmark with Last Round (Sidste Omgang), which won the jury and producers\u0027 awards at the Munich International Festival of Film Schools, and First Prize at Tel Aviv. That year Vinterberg made his first TV drama for DR TV and his short fiction film The Boy Who Walked Backwards, produced by Birgitte Hald at Nimbus Film.This film has won awards and accolades all over the world, including Nordic Panorama in Iceland, the International Short Film Festival in Clermont-Ferrand, and the Toronto International Film Festival.His first feature film was The Biggest Heroes (De Største Helte), a road movie that received acclaim in his native Denmark.In 1995, Vinterberg formed the Dogme 95 movement with Lars von Trier, Kristian Levring, and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen. Following that dogma in 1998, he conceived, wrote and directed (and also had a small acting role in) the first of the Dogme movies, The Celebration (Festen). As per the rules of the Dogme manifesto, he did not take a directorial credit. However, he and the film won numerous nominations and awards, including the Jury Prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.In 2003 he directed the apocalyptic science fiction love story It\u0027s All About Love, a movie he wrote, directed and produced himself over a period of five years. This movie was entirely in English and featured, among others, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, and Sean Penn. The movie did not do well, as critics and audiences found it idiosyncratic and somewhat incomprehensible. His next film, the English-language Dear Wendy (2005), scripted by Lars von Trier, also flopped, even in his native Denmark where it sold only 14,521 tickets. However he won the Silver George for Best Director at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. Vinterberg then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, En mand kommer hjem (2007), which also flopped, selling only 31,232 tickets.On 1 August 2008 he directed the music video for \"The Day That Never Comes\", the first single off Metallica\u0027s album Death Magnetic.His 2010 film Submarino was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.In 2012, his film The Hunt competed for the Palme d\u0027Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 86th Academy Awards.In 2015, he directed Far From The Madding Crowd, an adaptation of the acclaimed Thomas Hardy novel, starring Carey Mulligan, Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge.Vinterberg will reunite with Matthias Schoenaerts in Kursk, a film about the Kursk submarine disaster that happened in 2000.In April 2016, the French government appointed Vinterberg a Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.",

Other films directed by Ashby include The Landlord (1970), Harold and Maude (1971), The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976) and Being There (1979).Born William Hal Ashby in Ogden, Utah, he grew up in a Mormon household. His tumultuous childhood as part of a dysfunctional family included the divorce of his parents, his father\u0027s suicide, and dropping out of high school. Ashby was married and divorced by the time he was 19.As Ashby was entering adult life, he moved from Utah to California where he soon became an assistant film editor. After being nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing in 1967 for The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, his big break occurred in 1968 when he won the award for In the Heat of the Night.At the urging of producer Norman Jewison, Ashby directed his first film The Landlord in 1970. While his birth date placed him squarely within the realm of the prewar generation, the filmmaker quickly embraced the hippie lifestyle, adopting vegetarianism and growing his hair long. In 1970 he married actress Joan Marshall. While they remained married until his death in 1988, the two had separated by the mid-seventies, with Marshall never forgiving Ashby, along with Warren Beatty and Robert Towne, for dramatizing certain unflattering elements of her life in Shampoo.Over the next 16 years, Ashby directed several acclaimed and popular films, many were about outsiders and adventurers traversing the pathways of life. Aside from Shampoo, Ashby\u0027s most commercially successful film was the Vietnam War drama Coming Home (1978). Starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, both in Academy Award-winning performances, it was for this film that Ashby earned his only Best Director nomination from the Academy for his work.After Being There (his last film to achieve widespread attention), Ashby became notoriously reclusive and eccentric, retreating to his home in Malibu Colony. Later it was learned that Ashby was using drugs, and he slowly became difficult and unemployable.Attempting to turn a corner in his declining career, Ashby stopped using drugs, trimmed his hair and beard, and began to frequently attend Hollywood parties wearing a navy blue blazer so as to suggest that he was once again employable. Despite these efforts, he could only find work as a television director.Ashby died on December 27, 1988 at his home in Malibu, California.The Last Detail, Bound for Glory, Coming Home, and Being There were all nominated for the Palme d\u0027Or.",

Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years. Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshirō Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director\u0027s reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. Rashomon, which premiered in Tokyo in August 1950, and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese film artists. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work—including his final two epics, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to win awards, including the Palme d\u0027Or for Kagemusha, though more often abroad than in Japan. In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited as \"one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years\".Description above from the Wikipedia article Akira Kurosawa , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Spike Lee was born Shelton Lee in 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from a proud and intelligent background. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith\u0027s The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe\u0027s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee\u0027s next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She\u0027s Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million. Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. Lee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed a neighborhood on a very hot day, and the racial tensions that emerge. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo\u0027 Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington. His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee\u0027s handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee\u0027s next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March. His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994). He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. With pointed political messages, insightful, different and intelligent films, Spike Lee has become a well known political presence. He looks likely to have further success in the film business. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan. He and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, have two children.",

He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for 10, winning 4.The Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his \"strong direction of actors\", \"vigorous storytelling\" and the \"social realism\" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been \"one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.\" Lumet was also known as an \"actor\u0027s director,\" having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than \"any other director.\"Lumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his \"brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture.\" Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You\u0027re Dead (2007).Description above from the Wikipedia article Sidney Lumet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

He was noted for his ability to work across a range of genres and an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience.Nichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy improvisational troupe, The Compass Players, predecessor of The Second City, in Chicago. He then teamed up with his improv partner, Elaine May, to form the comedy duo Nichols and May. Their live improv acts were a hit on Broadway resulting in three albums, with their debut album winning a Grammy Award.After Nichols and May disbanded their act in 1961, Nichols began directing plays. He soon earned a reputation as a skilled Broadway director with a flair for creating innovative productions and the ability to elicit polished performances from actors. His debut Broadway play was Neil Simon\u0027s Barefoot in the Park in 1963, with Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. He next directed Luv in 1964 and in 1965 directed another Neil Simon play, The Odd Couple. Nichols received a Tony Award for each of those plays. Nearly five decades later, he won his sixth Tony Award as best director with a revival of Death of a Salesman in 2012. During his career, he directed or produced over twenty-five Broadway plays.In 1966, Warner Brothers invited Nichols to direct his first film, Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The groundbreaking and acclaimed film led critics to declare Nichols the \"new Orson Welles\". The film garnered 13 Academy Award nominations, winning five. It was also a box office hit and became the number 1 film of 1966. His next film was The Graduate in 1967, starring then unknown actor Dustin Hoffman, alongside Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross. The film was another critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1967 and receiving seven Academy Award nominations, winning Nichols the Academy Award for Best Directing. Among the other films he directed were Catch-22 (1970), Carnal Knowledge (1971), Silkwood (1983), Working Girl (1988), Wolf (1994), The Birdcage (1996), Closer (2004), and Charlie Wilson\u0027s War (2007).Along with an Academy Award, Nichols won a Grammy Award (the first for a comedian born outside the United States), four Emmy Awards and nine Tony Awards. He was also a three-time BAFTA Award winner. His other honors included the Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2010.

        "biography": "David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, television director, visual artist, musician and occasional actor. Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.Moving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.Proceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–1992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period.

Known for a distinct style that blends fantasy and baroque images, he is considered one of the most influential and widely revered filmmakers of the 20th century.Personal and highly idiosyncratic visions of society, Fellini\u0027s films are a unique combination of memory, dreams, fantasy and desire. The adjectives \"Fellinian\" and \"Felliniesque\" are \"synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general\".In a career spanning almost fifty years, Fellini won the Palme d\u0027Or for La Dolce Vita, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, and directed four motion pictures that won Oscars in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement at the 65th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles.Description above from the Wikipedia article Federico Fellini, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture for To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), Best Director for All the President\u0027s Men (1976) and Best Adapted Screenplay for Sophie\u0027s Choice (1982).Pakula was also notable for directing his \"paranoia trilogy\": All the President\u0027s Men, Klute (1971), and The Parallax View (1974).Pakula started his Hollywood career as an assistant in the cartoon department at Warner Brothers. In 1957, he undertook his first production role for Paramount Pictures. In 1962, he produced To Kill a Mockingbird, for which he was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. Pakula had a successful professional relationship as the producer of movies directed by Robert Mulligan from 1957 to 1968. In 1969, he directed his first feature, The Sterile Cuckoo, starring Liza Minnelli.In 1971, Pakula released the first installment of what would informally come to be known as his \"paranoia trilogy\". Klute, the story of a relationship between a private eye (played by Donald Sutherland) and a call girl (played by Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar for her performance), was a commercial and critical success. This was followed in 1974 by The Parallax View starring Warren Beatty, a labyrinthine post-Watergate thriller involving political assassinations. The film has been noted for its experimental use of hypnotic imagery in a celebrated film-within-a-film sequence in which the protagonist is inducted into the Parallax Corporation, whose main, albeit non-ostensible, enterprise is domestic terrorism.Finally, in 1976, Pakula rounded out the \"trilogy\" with All the President\u0027s Men, based on the bestselling account of the Watergate scandal written by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who were played in the movie by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, respectively. It was another commercial hit, considered by many critics and fans to be one of the best thrillers of the 1970s.Pakula scored another hit in 1982 with Sophie\u0027s Choice, starring Meryl Streep. His screenplay, based on the novel by William Styron, was nominated for an Academy Award. Later commercial successes included Presumed Innocent, based on the bestselling novel by Scott Turow, and another political thriller, The Pelican Brief, an adaptation of John Grisham\u0027s bestseller. His final film was the crime drama thriller film The Devil\u0027s Own, where he reunited with Harrison Ford.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alan J.

        "biography": "It might have been easy to write off American actor Warren Beatty as merely the younger brother of film star Shirley MacLaine, were it not for the fact that Beatty was a profoundly gifted performer whose creative range extended beyond mere acting. After studying at Northwestern University and with acting coach Stella_Adler, Beatty was being groomed for stardom almost before he was of voting age, cast in prominent supporting roles in TV dramas and attaining the recurring part of the insufferable Milton Armitage on the TV sitcom Dobie Gillis. Beatty left Dobie after a handful of episodes, writing off his part as \"ridiculous,\" and headed for the stage, where he appeared in a stock production of +Compulsion and in William Inge\u0027s Broadway play +A Loss of Roses.The actor\u0027s auspicious film debut occurred in Splendor in the Grass (1961), after which he spent a number of years being written off by the more narrow-minded movie critics as a would-be Brando. Both Beatty and his fans knew that there was more to his skill than that, and in 1965 Beatty sank a lot of his energy and money into a quirky, impressionistic crime drama, Mickey_One (1965). The film was a critical success but failed to secure top bookings, though its teaming of Beatty with director Arthur_Penn proved crucial to the shape of movie-making in the 1960s. With Penn again in the director\u0027s chair, Beatty took on his first film as producer/star, Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Once more, critics were hostile -- at first. A liberal amount of praise from fellow filmmakers and the word-of-mouth buzz from film fans turned Bonnie and Clyde into the most significant film of 1967 -- and compelled many critics to reverse their initial opinions and issue apologies. This isn\u0027t the place to analyze the value and influence Bonnie and Clyde had; suffice it to say that this one film propelled Warren Beatty from a handsome, talented film star into a powerful filmmaker.Picking and choosing his next projects very carefully, Beatty was offscreen as much as on from 1970 through 1975, though several of his projects -- most prominently McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and The_Parallax_View (1974) -- would be greeted with effusive praise by film critics and historians. In 1975, Beatty wrote his first screenplay, and the result was Shampoo (1975), a trenchant satire on the misguided mores of the late \u002760s. Beatty turned director for 1978\u0027s Heaven_Can_Wait, a delightful remake of Here_Comes_Mr._Jordan that was successful enough to encourage future Hollywood bankrolling of Beatty\u0027s directorial efforts. In 1981, Beatty produced, directed, co-scripted and acted in Reds, a spectacular recounting of the Russian Revolution as seen through the eyes of American Communist John Reed. It was a pet project of Beatty\u0027s, one he\u0027d been trying to finance since the 1970s (at that time, he\u0027d intended to have Sergei_Bondarchuk of War and Peace fame as director). Reds failed to win a Best Picture Academy Award, though Beatty did pick up an Oscar as Best Director. Nothing Beatty has done since Reds has been without interest; refusing to turn out mere vehicles, he has taken on a benighted attempt to re-spark the spirit of the old Hope-Crosby road movies (Ishtar [1984]); brought a popular comic strip to the screen, complete with primary colors and artistic hyperbole (Dick_Tracy [1991]); and managed to make the ruthless gangster Bugsy Siegel a sympathetic visionary (Bugsy [1992]). In 1998 he was able to breath new life into political satire with Bulworth, his much acclaimed film in which he plays a disillusioned politician who turns to rap to express himself. In 2001, Beatty rekindled memories of Ishtar as he starred in another phenomenal bust, Town \u0026amp; Country. Budgeted at an astronomical 90 million dollars and earning a miserable 6.7 million dollars during it\u0027s brief theatrical run, Town \u0026amp; Country was released three years after completion and pulled from theaters after a mere four weeks, moving critics to rank it among the biggest flops in movie history.Fiercely protective of his private life, and so much an advocate of total control that he will dictate the type of film stock and lighting to be used when being interviewed for television, Beatty has nonetheless had no luck at all in keeping his many amours out of the tabloids. However, Beatty\u0027s long and well-documented history of high-profile romances with such actresses as Leslie_Caron, Julie_Christie, Diane_Keaton, and Madonna came to an abrupt end upon his 1992 marriage to Bugsy co-star Annette_Bening, with whom he later starred in 1994\u0027s Love_Affair, his blighted remake of the 1957 An Affair to Remember.",

He wrote most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Key Largo (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), Moulin Rouge (1952), The Misfits (1961), and The Man Who Would Be King (1975). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston to Oscar wins in different films.Huston was known to direct with the vision of an artist, having studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He continued to explore the visual aspects of his films throughout his career: sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. In addition, while most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, making his films both more economical and more cerebral, with little editing needed.Most of Huston\u0027s films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting a “heroic quest,\" as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed or \"destructive alliances,” giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his themes also involved some of the \"grand narratives\" of the twentieth century, such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism and war.Before becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Huston has been referred to as \"a titan,\" \"a rebel\" and a \"renaissance man,\" in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as \"cinema\u0027s Ernest Hemingway,\" — a filmmaker who was \"never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.\"A statue of Huston, sitting in his directorial chair (pictured below), stands in Plaza John Huston Puerto Vallarta in Mexico.Description above from the Wikipedia article John Huston, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His influential body of work dealt with bleakness and despair as well as comedy and hope. Described by Woody Allen as \"probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion picture camera\", he is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential film directors of all time. However, despite critical acclaim, his films rarely earned large grosses or gained wide audiences.He directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television, most of which he also wrote, and directed over one hundred and seventy plays. Among his company of actors were Liv Ullmann, Bibi Andersson, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in the landscape of Sweden. His major subjects were death, illness, faith, betrayal, and insanity.Bergman was active for more than six decades. In 1976 his career was seriously threatened as the result of a botched criminal investigation for alleged income tax evasion. Outraged, Bergman suspended a number of pending productions, closed his studios, and went into self-imposed exile in Germany for eight years.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ingmar Bergman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

He was known for the innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence, as well as his revisionist approach to the Western genre.Peckinpah\u0027s films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals, and the corruption of violence in human society. He was given the nickname \"Bloody Sam\" owing to the violence in his films. His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable, but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.Peckinpah\u0027s combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, has often overshadowed his professional legacy. Many of his films were noted for behind-the-scenes battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime. Many of his films, such as Straw Dogs (1971), Pat Garrett \u0026amp; Billy the Kid (1973) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), remain controversial.Description above from the Wikipedia article Sam Peckinpah, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His four Academy Awards for Best Director (1935, 1940, 1941, 1952) is a record, and one of those films, How Green Was My Valley, also won Best Picture.In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Ford directed more than 140 films (although nearly all of his silent films are now lost) and he is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of his generation. Ford\u0027s films and personality were held in high regard by his colleagues, with Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles among those who have named him as one of the greatest directors of all time.In particular, Ford was a pioneer of location shooting and the long shot which frames his characters against a vast, harsh and rugged natural terrain.Description above from the Wikipedia article John Ford, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Keaton the 21st-greatest male star of all time. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton\u0027s \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies.\"Orson Welles stated that Keaton\u0027s The General is the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made. A 2002 worldwide poll by Sight \u0026 Sound ranked Keaton\u0027s The General as the 15th best film of all time.

He is best known as the director of the controversial and groundbreaking 1915 film The Birth of a Nation and the subsequent film Intolerance (1916).Griffith\u0027s film The Birth of a Nation made pioneering use of advanced camera and narrative techniques, and its immense popularity set the stage for the dominance of the feature-length film. It also proved extremely controversial at the time and ever since for its negative depiction of Black Americans and their supporters, and its positive portrayal of slavery and the Ku Klux Klan. Griffith responded to his critics with his next film, Intolerance, intended to show the dangers of prejudiced thought and behavior. The film was not the financial success that its predecessor had been, but was received warmly by critics. Several of his later films were also successful, but high production, promotional, and roadshow costs often made his ventures commercial failures. Even so, he is generally considered one of the most important figures of early cinema.Description above from the Wikipedia article D. W.

Along with other avant-garde artists of his generation (Jean Anouilh and René Char for example) Cocteau grappled with the algebra of verbal codes old and new, mise en scène language and technologies of modernism to create a paradox: a classical avant-garde.[citation needed] His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Kenneth Anger, Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, María Félix, Édith Piaf (whom he cast in one of his one-act plays entitled Le Bel Indifferent in 1940), and Raymond Radiguet.His work was played out in the theatrical world of the Grands Theatres, the Boulevards and beyond during the Parisian epoque he both lived through and helped define and create.

Clément studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1936, he directed his first film, a 20 minute short written and featuring Jacques Tati. Clément spent the latter part of the 1930s making documentaries in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In 1937, he and archaeologist Jules Barthou were in Yemen making preparations to film a documentary, the first ever of that country and one that includes the only known film image of Imam Yahya. Almost ten years passed before Clément directed a feature but his French Resistance film, La Bataille du rail (1945), gained much critical and commercial success. From there René Clément became one of his country\u0027s most successful and respected directors, garnering numerous awards including two films that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the first in 1950 for The Walls of Malapaga (Au-delà des grilles) and the second time two years later for Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits). Clément had international success with several films but his star-studded 1966 epic Is Paris Burning?, written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Paul Graetz was a costly box office failure. Clément continued to make a few films until his retirement in 1975, including an international success with Rider On The Rain that starred Charles Bronson and Marlène Jobert. In 1984 the French motion picture industry honored his lifetime contribution to film with a special César Award.

Cuarón\u0027s television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including Gaby: A True Story and Romero, and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, A Little Princess, an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett\u0027s classic novel.During his time studying in CUEC (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos) he met Mariana Elizondo, and with her he has his first son, Jonás Cuarón born 1981, in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico.",

Her most famous film was Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will), made at the 1934 Nuremberg congress of the Nazi Party. Riefenstahl\u0027s prominence in the Third Reich along with her personal friendship with Adolf Hitler thwarted her film career following Germany\u0027s defeat in World War II, after which she was arrested but released without any charges.Triumph of the Will gave Riefenstahl instant and lasting international fame, as well as infamy. Although she directed only eight films, just two of which received significant coverage outside of Germany, Riefenstahl was widely known all her life. The propaganda value of her films made during the 1930s repels most modern commentators but many film histories cite the aesthetics as outstanding. The Economist wrote that Triumph of the Will \"sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century\".In the 1970s Riefenstahl published her still photography of the Nuba tribes in Sudan in several books such as The Last of the Nuba. She was active up until her death and also published marine life stills and released the marine-based film Impressionen unter Wasser in 2002.After her death, the Associated Press described Riefenstahl as an \"acclaimed pioneer of film and photographic techniques\". Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in Berlin noted, \"Leni Riefenstahl conquered new ground in the cinema\". The BBC said her documentaries \"were hailed as groundbreaking film-making, pioneering techniques involving cranes, tracking rails, and many cameras working at the same time\".Description above from the Wikipedia article Leni Riefenstahl, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

With his weird counter-culture friends as his cast, he began making silent 8mm and 16mm films in the mid-\u002760s; he screened these in rented Baltimore church halls to underground audiences drawn by word of mouth and street leafleting campaigns. As his filmmaking grew more polished and his subject matter more shocking, his audiences grew bigger, and his write-ups in the Baltimore papers more outraged. By the early 1970s he was making features, which he managed to get shown in midnight screenings in art cinemas by sheer perseverance. Success came when Pink Flamingos (1972) - a deliberate exercise in ultra-bad taste - took off in 1973, helped no doubt by lead actor Divine\u0027s infamous dog-crap eating scene.Waters continued to make low-budget shocking movies with his Dreamland repertory company until Hollywood crossover success came with Hairspray (1988), and although his movies nowadays might now appear cleaned up and professional, they retain Waters\u0027 playfulness, and reflect his lifelong obsessions.",

He followed The Sixth Sense by writing and directing Unbreakable, released in 2000, which received positive reviews. His 2002 film Signs, where he also played Ray Reddy, gained both critical and financial success. His next movie The Village (2004) received mixed reviews from the critics, but turned out to be a financial success. His later fantasy film Lady in the Water (2006) performed worse critically and financially. The film The Happening (2008) was a financial success but also received negative reviews.

        "biography": "John Nicholas Cassavetes was a Greek-American actor, film director, and screenwriter. Cassavetes was a pioneer of American independent film, writing and directing over a dozen movies, which he partially self-financed, and pioneered the use of improvisation and a realistic cinéma vérité style. He also acted in many Hollywood films, notably Rosemary\u0027s Baby (1968) and The Dirty Dozen (1967). He studied acting with Don Richardson, using an acting technique based on muscle memory.By 1956, Cassavetes had begun teaching an alternative to method acting in his own workshop in New York City. An improvisation exercise in his workshop inspired the idea for his writing and directorial debut, Shadows. Cassavetes raised the funds for the production from friends and family, as well as listeners to Jean Shepherd\u0027s late-night radio talk-show Night People. His stated purpose was to make a film about little people, different from Hollywood studio productions.Cassavetes was unable to gain American distribution of Shadows, but it won the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. European distributors later released the movie in the US as an import. With payment for his work on television, as well as a handful of film acting jobs, he was able to relocate to California and to make his subsequent films independent of any studio, as Shadows had been.Faces (1968) was the second film to be both directed and independently financed by Cassavetes. The film starring his wife Gena Rowlands, whom he had married during his struggling actor days, depicts the slow disintegration of a marriage. Faces was nominated for three Academy Awards. Around this time, Cassavetes formed \"Faces International\" as a distribution company to handle his films.In 1970, Cassavetes directed and acted in Husbands, with Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara. They played a trio of married men on a spree in New York and London after the funeral of one of their best friends. Cassavetes stated this was a personal film for him; his older brother died at the age of 30.Minnie and Moskowitz (1971), about two unlikely lovers, featured Rowlands with Seymour Cassel. A Woman Under the Influence (1974) stars Rowlands as an increasingly troubled housewife. Rowlands received an Academy Award nomination, while Cassavetes was nominated for Best Director. In The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976), Ben Gazzara plays a small-time strip-club owner with a gambling habit, pressured by mobsters to commit a murder to pay off his debt. Opening Night (1977) Rowlands portrays an aging film star working in the theater and suffering a personal crisis. Cassavetes directed the film Gloria (1980), featuring Rowlands as a Mob moll who tries to protect an orphan boy. Rowlands earned another Best Actress nomination for it.After receiving the prognosis from his doctor that he had six months to live, Cassavetes made Love Streams (1984), which featured him as an aging playboy. It won the Golden Bear at the 34th Berlinale. Cassavetes died on February 3, 1989, at the age of 59. By then, he had amassed a collection of more than forty unproduced screenplays, as well as a novel, Husbands.The New Yorker wrote that Cassavetes \"may be the most influential American director of the last half century\".Description from the Wikipedia article John Cassavetes, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",

He became a member of the Comédie-Française just one year before World War II, but fled to Switzerland to escape the anti-Jewish persecutions by the Vichy government.After 1945 he restarted his career as an actor, performing in the theatre and in supporting roles in the cinema. Oury became a movie director in 1959 (The Itchy Palm (fr)) and gained his first success in 1961 with Crime Does Not Pay (Le crime ne paie pas).Joining André Bourvil and Louis de Funès as a comic duo, he burst into commercial filmmaking with 1965\u0027s The Sucker (Le corniaud). The film was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.[1] The following year, Don\u0027t Look Now... We\u0027re Being Shot At! (La Grande Vadrouille) was even more successful, attracting the largest audiences ever in France (17.27 million admissions). This box-office record stood for decades, only surpassed in 1997 by Titanic from James Cameron.Oury shot the 1969 comedy Le Cerveau (The Brain) in English, starring David Niven in the lead role as a criminal mastermind.Living together with the French actress Michèle Morgan, he was the father of French writer Danièle Thompson and grandfather of actor/writer Christopher Thompson.

        "biography": "Georges Méliès, full name Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès, was a French illusionist and filmmaker famous for leading many technical and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema. One of the first filmmakers to use multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, tracking shots, dissolves, and hand-painted color in his work, Méliès pioneered effects that would define cinematic special effects for decades to come.  A prolific innovator in the use of special effects, Méliès accidentally discovered the substitution stop trick in 1896, a method of creating seamless disappearing and/or appearing effects used throughout both films and television for decades to come.  Because of his ability to seemingly manipulate and transform reality through cinematography, Méliès is sometimes referred to as the first \"Cinemagician\".Two of his best-known films are A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904). Both stories involve strange, surreal voyages, somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy. Méliès was also an early pioneer of horror cinema, which can be traced back to his Le Manoir du diable (1896).  In early 1909 Méliès stopped making films to protest Thomas Edison\u0027s Motion Pictures Parents Company monopoly, and presided over the first meeting of the International Filmmakers Congress in Paris.  Further financial hardships created by his opposition to Edison and diminishing influence, Méliès disappeared from public life. By the mid-1920s he made a meager living as a candy and toy salesma in Paris, with the assistance of funds collected by other filmmakers.  Although he was recognized for his contributions in cinema, Méliès spent most of his later years in poverty before being accepted into La Maison du Retraite du Cinéma, the film industry\u0027s retirement home in Orly.  ",

As a film director and actor, he made more than forty films from the silent era to the end of the 1960s. As an author, he wrote the definitive biography of his father, the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Renoir, My Father (1962).During the 1930s Renoir enjoyed great success as a filmmaker. In 1931 he directed his first sound films, On purge bébé and La Chienne (The Bitch). The following year he made Boudu Saved From Drowning (Boudu sauvé des eaux), a farcical sendup of the pretensions of a middle-class bookseller and his family, who meet with comic, and ultimately disastrous, results when they attempt to reform a vagrant played by Michel Simon.By the middle of the decade Renoir was associated with the Popular Front, and several of his films, such as The Crime of Monsieur Lange (Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, 1935), La Vie Est a Nous (People of France) (1936) and La Marseillaise (1938), reflect the movement\u0027s politics. In 1937 he made one of his most well-known films, Grand Illusion (La Grande Illusion), starring Erich von Stroheim and the immensely popular Jean Gabin. A film on the theme of brotherhood about a series of escape attempts by French POWs during World War I, it was enormously successful but was also banned in Germany, and later in Italy after having won the \"Best Artistic Ensemble\" award at the Venice Film Festival. This was followed by another cinematic success: The Human Beast (La Bête Humaine) (1938), a film noir tragedy based on the novel by Émile Zola and starring Simone Simon and Jean Gabin.",

        "biography": "Cameron Bruce Crowe (born July 13, 1957) is an American screenwriter and film director.Before moving into the film industry, Crowe was a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine, for which he still frequently writes. Crowe has made his mark with character-driven, personal films that have been generally hailed as refreshingly original and devoid of cynicism. Michael Walker in The New York Times called Crowe \"something of a cinematic spokesman for the post-baby boom generation\" because his first few films focused on that specific age group, first as highers and then as young adults making their way in the world.Crowe\u0027s debut screenwriting effort, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego, California, where he met Geraldine Edwards, who was a student there, and who he later based his Penny Lane character on in Almost Famous, when he discovered she was going backstage to rock and roll concerts. Later, he wrote and directed one more high school saga, Say Anything, and then Singles, a story of Seattle twentysomethings that was woven together by a soundtrack centering on that city\u0027s burgeoning grunge music scene.Crowe landed his biggest hit, though, with Jerry Maguire. After this, he was given a green light to go ahead with a pet project, the autobiographical effort Almost Famous. Centering on a teenage music journalist on tour with an up-and-coming band, it gave insight to his life as a 15-year-old writer for Rolling Stone. Crowe has stated that the Penny Lane character was based on his fellow San Diegan, Geraldine Edwards, who he met in 1975, as mentioned earlier. Part of the dialogue is also inspired by comments that were made by Bebe Buell in certain interviews. Also, in late 1999, Crowe released his second book, Conversations with Billy Wilder, a question and answer session with the legendary director.Description above from the Wikipedia article Cameron Crowe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor, composer, and occasional actor. Although Carpenter has worked in numerous film genres in his four-decade career, his name is most commonly associated with horror and science fiction.Most films in Carpenter\u0027s career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984). However, many of Carpenter\u0027s films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be viewed as cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. Cult classics that Carpenter directed include: Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995).His films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of steadicam, and distinctive synthesized scores. Carpenter is also notable for having composed or co-composed most of the music of his films; some of them are now considered cult as well, with the main theme of Halloween being considered a part of popular culture. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics. He released his first studio album Lost Themes in 2015, and also won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Vampires (1998).Carpenter is an outspoken proponent of widescreen filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were filmed anamorphic with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was shot in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\", preferring it over both digital and 3D film.Many of Carpenter\u0027s films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features.Carpenter has been the subject of the documentary film John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies, and American Cinematheque\u0027s 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed Halloween to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.In 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his The Director\u0027s Chair series on El Rey Network.Many filmmakers have been influenced by Carpenter, including James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino ((The Hateful Eight was heavily influenced by The Thing), Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bong Joon-ho, among others. The video game Dead Space 3 is said to be influenced by Carpenter\u0027s The Thing, The Fog and Halloween, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film.Description above from the Wikipedia article John Carpenter, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Leading actress Bette Davis once remarked of him, \"He isn\u0027t an actor—he\u0027s a chameleon.\"Sellers rose to fame on the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show. His ability to speak in different accents (e.g., French, Indian, American, German, as well as British regional accents), along with his talent to portray a range of characters to comic effect, contributed to his success as a radio personality and screen actor and earned him national and international nominations and awards. Many of his characters became ingrained in public perception of his work. Sellers\u0027 private life was characterized by turmoil and crises, and included emotional problems and substance abuse. Sellers was married four times, and had three children from the first two marriages.An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played, but he left his own portrait since, \"he obsessively filmed his homes, his family, people he knew, anything that took his fancy right to the end of his life—intimate film that remained undiscovered until long after his death in 1980.\" The director Peter Hall has said: \"Peter had the ability to identify completely with another person, and think his way physically, mentally and emotionally into their skin. Where does that come from? I have no idea. Is it a curse? Often. I think it\u0027s not enough though in this business to have talent. You have to have talent to handle the talent.

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog (1955), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps.Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Last Year at Marienbad (1961), and Muriel (1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave (la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the \"Left Bank\" group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg.In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alain Resnais, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He directed movies such as Vidas Secas (Barren Lives), based on the book with the same name by Brazilian writer Graciliano Ramos. He also directed Rio 40°(his first feature film) which was released in 1955. The film is a chronicle of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and it influenced several other directors, spurring the Cinema Novo moment.His most well-known film outside of Brazil is Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês (How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, 1971). It was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival.[1] The film takes place in the sixteenth century and details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the (now extinct) indigenous Tupinamba warrior tribe against the French and Portuguese colonizers of the Brazilian littoral. The film is something of a black comedy about European colonialism—one that makes satirical use of the Brazilian modernist trope of Antropofagia (\"cultural cannibalism\"), then recently revived by the Tropicalismo movement of the 1960s—as well as a bitter commentary on the historical genocide of the indigenous tribes in Latin America and the gradual destruction of their civilization.Recently, dos Santos has started production on a movie called Brasília 18%, which explores some of the darker aspects of contemporary Brazilian politics such as political corruption, the murder of trial witnesses, and money laundering.Santos belongs to the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2006.Description above from the Wikipedia article Nelson Pereira   licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Robbery (1967), a crime thriller, is a fictionalised version of the Great Train Robbery of 1963. This led to Bullitt (1968), of which Bruce Weber has written, \"Mr. Yates’s reputation probably rests most securely on “Bullitt” (1968), his first American film — and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.\"Yates was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Direction for Bullitt (1968). Yates produced and directed Breaking Away (1979), which was nominated for five Academy Awards (\"Oscars\") including Best Director and Best Film for Yates. Yates also produced and directed The Dresser (1983), which was an adaptation of the Ronald Harwood stage play. The film received seven BAFTA and five Oscar nominations, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film and for Best Direction and the Academy Award for Best Film and for Best Director for Yates.

        "biography": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was For Me and My Gal (1942) with Judy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw An American in Paris (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by George Gershwin and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as Fred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style. Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.",

Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world.Jeunet and Caro\u0027s first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.They next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children\u0027s dreams so that he can live indefinitely.The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie.

He was considered one of the last remaining directors who insisted on having complete control over all elements of production, making his style unique in Hollywood.His 30 feature films and over 50 plays for television were notable for their influence on contemporary thought. He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller,\" having begun his career at the peak of the Cold War. Many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.Movie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment—things that were facing us all.\" Among his credits were The Manchurian Candidate (1962), Birdman of Alcatraz (also 1962), The Train, (1964), Seven Days in May (also 1964) and Ronin (1998).Description above from the Wikipedia article John Frankenheimer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman.Rosenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sara (née Kaminsky) and David Rosenberg. He studied Irish literature at New York University in Manhattan, and began working as an apprentice film editor while in graduate school.After advancing to film editor, he then transitioned into directing with episodes of the syndicated TV series Decoy (1957–59). It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the ABC police-detective series Naked City, also shot in New York City. Fifteen episodes of The Untouchables followed, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk\u0027s The Trials of O\u0027Brien, among other shows. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.Following the Lutheran-financed U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Germany, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV-movie, Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game before making his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce\u0027s chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon\u0027s production company, Jalem.

He was famous for straight dramas and, especially, crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after \u0027Cool Hand Luke\u0027 was The Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Daryl Hannah.He made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, in 1991.In 1993, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute.

He was survived by his wife, Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at NYU; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director; as well as four grandchildren.His students\u0027 films The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Alphabet Killer, and The Wrestler that were released in 2008 were dedicated in memory of him.Description above from the Wikipedia article Stuart Rosenberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Martin Koolhoven (born April 25, 1969 in The Hague) is a Dutch film director and screenwriter.Born as Martinus Wouter Koolhoven, Koolhoven graduated from Dutch film school in 1996 and almost immediately made an impact on the Dutch film industry with his 53 minute television film Duister Licht (\"Dark Light\") in which the slaughtering of a pig was shown. The film was nominated twice at the Dutch Film Festival.It was his next (and first feature length) film however that established his name, also outside of the Netherlands. Suzy Q (also made for television) became the most awarded Dutch film of 1999 and established both Koolhoven\u0027s career and that of actress Carice van Houten, who Koolhoven worked with several times in the films to come.His first film for the cinema, AmnesiA, got a small theatical release in New York.Koolhoven started off with strongly stylized films that were all hailed by the critics, but never gained commercial success. In 2005 that changed when he went into the mainstream with Schnitzel Paradise, that not only got him rave reviews (both inside and outside the Netherlands), but was the highest grossing Dutch film of that year. The film was shown at many international film festivals (amongst them the Berlin Film Festival and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival where it was part of the Variety Critic\u0027s choice.) The film was sold to more than 20 countries, which is a remarkable amount for a Dutch film.In the same year Koolhoven released Bonkers, which internationally became his most awarded film and performed well at the box office. He also was the first director to have two films in the Dutch box office top 20.\"n Beetje Verliefd (2006) (Happy Family) was his third hit film in two years time, earning him another Golden Film. It was followed in 2008 by Oorlogswinter (Winter in Wartime), a Dutch movie based on the hit novel by the same name, written by Jan Terlouw, which went platinum. The movie was praised by almost all critics (including Variety that wrote a raving review) and was an enormous succes at the box office, being the number one movie at Christmas 2008 in The Netherlands.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Robert Hossein (born as Hosseinhof December 30, 1927 in Paris) is a French film actor of Parsi origin, director and writer. He directed the 1982 adaption of Les Misérables, and appeared in Vice and Virtue, Le Casse, Les Uns et les Autres and Venus Beauty Institute. His most recent roles include starring as Michèle Mercier\u0027s husband in the Angélique series and as a Catholic priest who falls in love with Claude Jade and becomes a communist in Prêtres interdits (Forbidden Priests) in 1973.Hossein started directing films in 1956 with Les salauds vont en enfer from a story by Frédéric Dard whose novels and plays went on to furnish Hossein with much of his later film material. Right from the start Hossein established his characteristic trademarks: using a seemingly straightforward suspense plot and subverting its conventions (sometimes to the extent of a complete disregard of the traditional demand for a final twist or revelation) in order to concentrate on ritualistic relationships. This is the director\u0027s running preoccupation which is always stressed in his films by an extraordinary command of film space and often striking frame compositions where the geometry of human figures and set design is used to accentuate the psychological set-up of the scene. The mechanisms of guilt and the way it destroys relationships is another recurring theme, presumably influenced by Hossein\u0027s lifelong interest in the works of Dostoyevski.Although Hossein had some modest international successes with films like Toi, le venin and Le vampire de Dusseldorf, he was much singled out for scorching criticism by the critics and followers of the New Wave for the unashamedly melodramatic frameworks of his films. The fact that he was essentially an auteur director with a consistent set of themes and an extraordinary mastery of original and unusual approaches to staging his stories, was never appreciated. He was not averse to trying his hand at widely different genres and was never defeated, making the strikingly different spaghetti western Une corde, un Colt and the low-budgeted but daringly subversive period drama J\u0027ai tué Raspoutine. However, because of the lack of wider success and continuing adverse criticism, Hossein virtually ended his film directing career in 1970, having concentrated on theatre where his achievements were never questioned, and subsequently returning to film directing only twice. With two or three exceptions, his films remain commercially unavailable and very difficult to see.He is the son of André Hossein a Zoroastrian French composer of Azerbaijani-Tajik descent, and a Jewish comedy actress from Kiev. He was married three times: first to Marina Vlady (he has two sons with her, Pierre and Igor), later to Caroline Eliacheff (with whom he has a son, Nicholas). He is currently married to actress Candice Patou, with whom he has one son, Julien.According to an article written by Emannuel Peze, Hossein experienced a conversion to Catholicism in 1971 during a visit to the Marian apparition at San Damiano in Lombardo Italy.Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Hossein, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Rupert Julian performed on stage and in film both in his native country and Australia before emigrating to the United States in 1911, where he started his career as an actor in Universal silent movies. He turned to directing in 1915, often directing his wife Elsie Jane Wilson, but his work was merely routine until he was assigned to complete Merry-Go-Round in 1923 when director Erich von Stroheim was fired from it. In 1924, he directed Lon Chaney in the first cut of The Phantom of the Opera, which was largely revisited at the request of the production. He soon fell into a professional decline after the advent of sound, and after directing The Cat Creeps and Love Comes Along (both in 1930), his career faded.Rupert Julian died in Hollywood, California at the age of 64 and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.Description above from the Wikipedia article Rupert Julian, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Robert Rossen (March 16, 1908 – February 18, 1966) was an American screenwriter, film director, and producer whose film career spanned almost three decades. His 1949 film All the King\u0027s Men won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, while Rossen was nominated for an Oscar as Best Director. He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture. In 1961 he made The Hustler, which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Sidney Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award.After directing and writing for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Against the War, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros., making an enemy of Jack Warner. After making one film for Hal Wallis\u0027s new-formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.Rossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947, and believed the Party was \"dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in.\"[1] However, he finally ended all relations with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist. As a result he was unofficially blacklisted by the Hollywood studio bosses, and he was unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and was removed from the unofficial blacklist.After this, he had to produce his next film, Mambo, in Italy in 1954 to repair his finances. While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success, conflict with the star of Lilith so disillusioned Rossen that he made no more films during the last three years of his life.Rossen\u0027s films for Warner generally described the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. He wrote that ambition and the desire for success were common themes in his work. His films often featured strong female characters. All Rossen\u0027s playscripts were adaptions except three which were based on real events. While head of production at Warner, Wallis considered that some of his best films were written by Rossen.Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Rossen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Some of his other films include Sorcerer, Cruising, To Live and Die in L.A., Jade, Rules of Engagement, The Hunted, Bug, and Killer Joe.As mentioned in Friedkin\u0027s voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Vertigo, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1965, called \"Off Season\". Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.In 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, Good Times starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley\u0027s The Boys in the Band and most notably The Birthday Party, based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.In 1971, his The French Connection was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973\u0027s The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty\u0027s best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.Following these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood; In 1973 the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed The Conversation and Bogdanovich, the Henry James adaptation, Daisy Miller, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.Friedkin\u0027s later movies did not achieve the same success.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin\u0027s films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin\u0027s own The French Connection (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011 Friedkin directed Killer Joe, a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey. Killer Joe premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.In April 2013 Friedkin published a memoir, The Friedkin Connection. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September.Description above from the Wikipedia article William Friedkin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He produced \"enigmatic and intricate mood pieces\" and rejected action in favor of contemplation, focusing on image and design over character and story. His films defined a \"cinema of possibilities\".Antonioni received numerous awards and nominations throughout his career, including the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize (1960, 1962), Palme d\u0027Or (1966), and 35th Anniversary Prize (1982); the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion (1955), Golden Lion (1964), FIPRESCI Prize (1964, 1995), and Pietro Bianchi Award (1998); the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon eight times; and an honorary Academy Award in 1995.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Louis Marie Malle was a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. His film Le Monde du silence won the Palme d\u0027Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony with the award instead being presented to the film\u0027s co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of the few directors to have won the Golden Lion multiple times.Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film Ascenseur pour l\u0027échafaud (1958), the World War II drama Lacombe, Lucien (1974), the romantic crime film Atlantic City (1980), the comedy-drama My Dinner with Andre (1981), and the autobiographical film Au revoir les enfants (1987).Malle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France. He initially studied political science at Sciences Po before turning to film studies at IDHEC instead.He worked as the co-director and cameraman to Jacques Cousteau on the documentary The Silent World (1956), which won an Oscar and the Palme d\u0027Or at the 1956 Academy Awards and Cannes Film Festival respectively. He assisted Robert Bresson on A Man Escaped (French title: Un condamné à mort s\u0027est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut, 1956) before making his first feature, Ascenseur pour l\u0027échafaud in 1957 (Elevator to the Gallows). A taut thriller featuring an original score by Miles Davis, Ascenseur pour l\u0027échafaud made an international film star of Jeanne Moreau, at the time a leading stage actress of the Comédie-Française. Malle was 24 years old.Malle\u0027s The Lovers (Les Amants, 1958), which also starred Moreau, caused major controversy due to its sexual content, leading to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the legal definition of obscenity.Malle is sometimes associated with the nouvelle vague movement. Malle\u0027s work does not directly fit in with or correspond to the auteurist theories that apply to the work of Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Rohmer and others, and he had nothing whatsoever to do with the Cahiers du cinéma. However, it does exemplify many of the characteristics of the movement, such as using natural light and shooting on location, and his film Zazie dans le métro (\"Zazie in the Metro,\" 1960, an adaptation of the Raymond Queneau novel) inspired Truffaut to write an enthusiastic letter to Malle.In 1968 Malle visited India and made a seven-part documentary series L\u0027Inde fantôme: Reflexions sur un voyage and a documentary film Calcutta, which was released in cinemas. Concentrating on real India, its rituals and festivities, Malle fell afoul of the Indian government, which disliked his portrayal of the country, in its fascination with the pre-modern, and consequently banned the BBC from filming in India for several years. Malle later claimed his documentary on India was his favorite film.Malle later moved to the United States and continued to direct there. Just as his earlier films such as The Lovers helped popularize French films in the United States, My Dinner with Andre was at the forefront of the rise of American independent cinema in the 1980s.",

While working in Sweden he met Arlene Klasky, an American-born animator. The two subsequently started their own company, Klasky Csupo, which produced many popular animated television shows. He was credited as \"animation executive producer\" and \"supervising animation director\" for several episodes of The Simpsons[4] in the early seasons before the show switched over to Film Roman.His record label, Tone Casualties, founded in 1994, released several industrial, noise, ambient and experimental music releases, including discs by Holger Czukay, Drew Neumann, Paul Schütze, Kuroi Mori, Borut Kržišnik, Wahorn, Controlled Bleeding and his own works.He also directed two live action films outside of Klasky Csupo: Bridge to Terabithia for Walt Disney Pictures, and The Secret of Moonacre for Warner Bros. and Lionsgate.The character design of Dr. Nick Riviera (from The Simpsons) is based somewhat on Csupó.

Medem was born in San Sebastián, Basque Country and showed an interest in movies since childhood, when he would take his father\u0027s Super 8 camera and shoot at night, while nobody was paying attention. After college graduation (where he earned degrees in Medicine and General Surgery) he worked as a film critic and later as a screenwriter, assistant director and editor. After a few shorts he directed his first full length feature, Vacas (\u0027Cows\u0027) for which he won a Goya Award. After this film he directed The Red Squirrel and Earth, both receiving good reviews at Cannes. In his next movie, Lovers of the Arctic Circle, which has been compared to the works of Krzysztof Kieślowski, he explored circular narrative and a taste for minimalistic textures that he then overcame in his next film, Sex and Lucia, where the plot dissolves into a very lyrical eroticism. After this film he took a tangent from his style to direct and produce La pelota vasca (\u0027The Basque Ball\u0027), a documentary film about the political problems of the Basque Country, which caused a furor amongst Spain\u0027s right wing politicians. Following this, his film Caótica Ana debuted in 2007.Description above from the Wikipedia article Julio Médem, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is the elder brother of actor Silvio Muccino, who often appears in his brother\u0027s films.Born in Rome, Gabriele Muccino gained success with films such as L\u0027ultimo bacio (One Last Kiss) and Remember Me, My Love (Ricordati di me) with Monica Bellucci.He is currently making a switch to directing Hollywood films after L\u0027ultimo bacio won the Audience Award for World Cinema at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival bringing him to the attention of the American film industry. Muccino was handpicked by Will Smith to serve as the director of The Pursuit of Happyness. Said Muccino in a later interview, \"Will had to defend me as a choice to the studio; I could barely speak English and I could barely express my vision. I felt protected and that I could push my ideas even when they weren\u0027t totally conventional. The reason why I found respect, and respect for my ideas, was because of Will.\" Muccino also directed Smith\u0027s later film, Seven Pounds.Description above from the Wikipedia article Gabriele Muccino, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1999, the American Film Institute named Poitier among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time, ranking 22nd on the list of 25.Poitier has directed a number of popular movies such as A Piece of the Action; Uptown Saturday Night, and Let\u0027s Do It Again (with friend Bill Cosby), and Stir Crazy (starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder). In 2002, 38 years after receiving the Best Actor Award, Poitier was chosen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to receive an Honorary Award, designated \"To Sidney Poitier in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.\" Since 1997 he has been the Bahamian ambassador to Japan.

        "biography": "Robert Aldrich was an American film director, writer and producer, notable for such films as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Big Knife (1955), What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), The Dirty Dozen (1967).Born in Cranston, Rhode Island, the son of Lora Lawson and newspaper publisher Edward Burgess Aldrich. He was a grandson of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. He studied economics at the University of Virginia.In 1941, he dropped out of college for a $50-a-week job at RKO Radio Pictures. In doing so, he was also dropped by his family, losing a potential stake in Chase Bank he would have inherited. It\u0027s been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich—and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"He quickly rose in film production as an assistant director, and worked with Jean Renoir, Abraham Polonsky, Robert Rossen, Joseph Losey and Charlie Chaplin as an assistant on Limelight. He became a television director in the 1950s, directing his first feature film, Big Leaguer, in 1953. During the 1950s, Aldrich directed mostly action films like Apache and Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster.Aldrich soon gained recognition as an auteur filmmaker, depicting his liberal humanist thematic vision in many genres, in films such as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), a film noir classic, The Big Knife (1955), an adaptation of Clifford Odets\u0027s play about Hollywood business, and Attack (1956), a WWII infantry combat film exploring how U.S. Army careerism determined who attacked and who ordered the attack.In the 1960s, he directed several commercially successful films, such as the gothic horror stories What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as spiteful sisters and faded child-actresses, Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte, with Bette Davis as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane (both Joan Crawford and Davis were to appear, but Crawford left the film); the controversial The Killing of Sister George (1968); and the hugely popular war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).The success of The Dirty Dozen allowed him to establish his own production studio for some time, but several failures forced his return to conventionally commercial Hollywood films. Nevertheless, his humanism is evident in The Longest Yard (1974), about the rigged-game politics, and Ulzana\u0027s Raid (1972) an uncompromising film based on the real life break-out from an Indian reservation of a band led by chief Ulzana, the extreme violence and torture they exacted upon isolated pioneer families in the Arizona territory, and their pursuit by the US cavalry.From his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941–65), Robert Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business: Adell, William, Alida and Kelly.Aldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983 in a Los Angeles hospital.Film critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: \"He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career. His aggressive and pugnacious film-making style, often crass and crude, but never less than utterly vital and alive, warrants – and will richly reward – your immediate attention.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Aldrich, licensed under CC-BY-SA",

Known for their sparse style, dramatic rocky locations near Lone Pine, California, and recurring stories of a lone man seeking vengeance amidst a brutal and abstract landscape, the films have, decades after their release, come to be known as some of the most important Westerns ever made,[citation needed] often compared to the works of existential writers or to narratives from the Old Testament. Until 2008, only Seven Men From Now had received a special edition DVD release, and the remainder of Boetticher\u0027s most acclaimed films, including Ride Lonesome, The Tall T, Comanche Station, Decision at Sundown, and Buchanan Rides Alone, which were once unavailable, had a DVD release on November 4, 2008 as the Budd Boetticher Box Set.Description above from the Wikipedia article  Budd Boetticher, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He won Emmy Awards for his direction on East Side/West Side in 1964 and The Glass House in 1972.In the cinema, Gries directed some low-budget movies in the 1950s before concentrating his efforts more on TV. In the late 1960s, he wrote and directed what is generally acknowledged to be his greatest work in either medium, the western Will Penny, which starred Charlton Heston and was released in 1968. It was based on an episode of the TV series The Westerner that Gries wrote and directed in 1960, entitled \"Line Camp\". Gries subsequently made two other films with Heston, the much less successful Number One, and The Hawaiians, and directed several other films with other high profile actors such as Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson into the 1970s, though they failed to reach the critical approval that Will Penny received. The most successful of his later works was Helter Skelter, made in 1976, which was a TV film based on the notorious Charles Manson Family.During post-production on his final film, The Greatest (1977), a biography on boxer Muhammed Ali (in which Ali also played himself), Tom Gries collapsed and died of a heart attack while playing tennis. He was 54 years old.He is the father of actor/director Jon Gries (who appeared under the name Jon Francis in Will Penny as a child actor).Description above from the Wikipedia article Tom Gries, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

(Photo Chemical Laboratories, a film company later incorporated into Toho Studios). He studied under director Satsuo Yamamoto, as did Akira Kurosawa, Ishirō Honda, and Senkichi Taniguchi. When the latter two trainees were drafted into Japan\u0027s war in China, Oda found his career accelerated. He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya, after a relatively scant few years of training. Perhaps because of this relative lack of training, and certainly because Oda was not drafted into the army, P.C.L. and Toho kept Oda going as a maker of programmers - trivial pictures that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters, but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement.Probably his most distinguished credits are Lady From Hell (1949, based on a Kurosawa script), Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror classic inspired by The Invisible Man, a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man. The only film he made ever to be shown outside Japan was the second Godzilla film, Godzilla Raids Again (1955), released in the United States as Gigantis, the Fire Monster. Toho insisted that Oda direct as many as seven movies a year, knowing that he could be trusted to deliver them on time. Over his entire career, Motoyoshi Oda directed fifty movies, not to mention his work as assistant director and second-unit direction on Ishiro Honda\u0027s Eagle of the Pacific (1953). No credits are available for Oda during the last 15 years of his life, after 1958.Description above from the Wikipedia article Motoyoshi Oda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.Chan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.Chan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul\u0027s residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.In 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school\u0027s best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung.   He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.",

He made his Broadway debut in the Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II musical Very Warm for May in 1939 and appeared in My Sister Eileen the following year. His screen acting credits include The World Moves On (1934), Jane Eyre (1934), Babes on Broadway (1941), My Sister Eileen (1942), and Words and Music (1948), among others. At MGM he became friends with Mickey Rooney and later directed several of Rooney\u0027s films.During World War II, Quine served in the United States Coast Guard, He married actress Susan Peters in November 1943. After the war, he tried directing, first as co-producer and co-director on Leather Gloves (1948), with William Asher, before his first solo effort on the musical The Sunny Side of the Street (1951). His directing credits include Pushover (1954), My Sister Eileen (1955), Operation Mad Ball (1957), Bell, Book and Candle (1958), Strangers When We Meet (1960), and The World of Suzie Wong (1960).He also produced such films as the comedy Paris, When It Sizzles (1964) with Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, How to Murder Your Wife (1965) with Jack Lemmon, Synanon (1966), and Hotel (1967).By the late 1960s, his output fell, and in the 1970s, Quine made only a few disappointing films. Turning to television, he had in the 1954-1955 season created with Blake Edwards the first Mickey Rooney series, The Mickey Rooney Show: Hey, Mulligan, which aired on NBC. Quine later directed three episodes of Peter Falk\u0027s Columbo, including Dagger Of The Mind, an episode set in Britain which some UK fans of that series regard as an embarrassment. He also worked on, another, much less successful NBC Mystery Movie series, McCoy starring Tony Curtis.His final work was on The Prisoner of Zenda (1979) with Peter Sellers, although he was briefly part of the crew for another Sellers film, The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), for which he received no credit.His first wife, whom he married on 11 July 1943, was actress Susan Peters, who was crippled from the waist down on a hunting trip with Quine in 1945 with Quine when she reached to the ground for her 22-caliber rifle, and it accidentally discharged. The bullet lodged in her spine. They divorced in 1948, and she died of the effects of anorexia nervosa in 1952, at age 31. On 17 April 1946, the couple adopted an infant, whom they named Timothy Richard Quine.Quine was later engaged to Kim Novak, but the two did not marry. He also married Barbara Bushman (by whom he had two daughters, Katherine and Victoria), Fran Jeffries, and Diana Balfour.After an extended period of depression and poor health, Quine committed suicide by shooting himself in Los Angeles on June 10, 1989.Description above from the Wikipedia article Richard Quine, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Like his colleagues and contemporaries Godard, Truffaut, Rohmer and Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cinéma before beginning his career as a film maker.Chabrol\u0027s career began with Le Beau Serge (1958), inspired by Hitchcock\u0027s Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in Les Biches (1968), La Femme Infidèle (1969) and Le Boucher (1970) — all featuring his then-wife, Stéphane Audran. Sometimes characterized as a \"mainstream\" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozière. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary (1991) and La Ceremonie (1996).Description above from the Wikipedia article Claude Chabrol, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Marshall co-directed How the West Was Won with John Ford and Henry Hathaway, handling the railroad segment, which featured a celebrated buffalo stampede sequence. While Marshall worked on almost all kinds of films imaginable, he started his career in the early silent period doing mostly Westerns, a genre he never completely abandoned. Later in his career, he was particularly sought after for comedies. He did around half a dozen films each with Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis, and also worked with W.C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Will Rogers and Laurel and Hardy.For his contribution to the film industry, George Marshall has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7048 Hollywood Boulevard.Description above from the Wikipedia article George  Marshall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He won an Academy Award for Best Director for Midnight Cowboy, and was nominated for two other films (Darling and Sunday Bloody Sunday).Schlesinger was born in London, into a middle class Jewish family. His acting career began in the 1950s and consisted of supporting roles in British films and television productions. He began his directorial career in 1956 with the short documentary Sunday in the Park about London\u0027s Hyde Park. In 1958, Schlesinger created a documentary on Benjamin Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival for the BBC\u0027s Monitor TV programme, including rehearsals of the children\u0027s opera Noye\u0027s Fludde featuring a young Michael Crawford.By the 1960s, he had virtually given up acting to concentrate on a directing career, and another of his earlier directorial efforts, the British Transport Films\u0027 documentary Terminus (1961), gained a Venice Film Festival Gold Lion and a British Academy Award. His first two fiction films, A Kind of Loving (1962) and Billy Liar (1963) were set in the North of England. A Kind of Loving won the Golden Bear award at the 12th Berlinale in 1962. His third feature film, Darling (1965), tartly described the modern, urban way of life in London and was one of the first films about \u0027swinging London\u0027. Schlesinger\u0027s next film was the period drama Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), an adaptation of Thomas Hardy\u0027s popular novel accentuated by beautiful English country locations. Both films (and Billy Liar) featured Julie Christie as the female lead.Schlesinger\u0027s next film, Midnight Cowboy (1969), was internationally acclaimed. A story of two hustlers living on the fringe in the bad side of New York City, it was Schlesinger\u0027s first film shot in the US, and it won Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture. During the 1970s, he made an array of films that were mainly about loners, losers and people outside the clean world, such as Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), The Day of the Locust (1975), Marathon Man (1976) and Yanks (1979). Later, came the major box office and critical failure of Honky Tonk Freeway (1981), followed by films that attracted mixed responses from the publicFrom 1973, he was an associate director of the Royal National Theatre, where he produced George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Heartbreak House (1975). He also directed several operas, beginning with Les contes d\u0027Hoffmann (1980) and Der Rosenkavalier (1984), both at Covent Garden.Schlesinger was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to film in 1970.

At the age of 31, he became a naturalized citizen.His best known films from the pre-McCarthy period of his career were film noirs Crossfire, for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and Murder, My Sweet, the latter an adaptation of Raymond Chandler\u0027s Farewell My Lovely. In addition, he made two World War II films: Hitler\u0027s Children, the story of the Hitler youth and Back to Bataan starring John Wayne.The late 1940\u0027s was the time of the Second Red Scare, and Dmytryk was one of many filmmakers investigated. Summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he refused to cooperate and was sent to jail. After spending several months behind bars, Dmytryk made the decision to testify again, and give the names of his fellow members in the American Communist Party as the HUAC had demanded. On April 25, 1951, Dmytryk appeared before HUAC for the second time, answering all questions. He spoke of his own Party past, a very brief membership in 1945, including the naming of twenty-six former members of left-wing groups. He explained how John Howard Lawson, Adrian Scott, Albert Maltz and others had pressured him to include communist propaganda in his films. His testimony damaged several court cases that others of the so-called \"Hollywood 10\" had filed. He recounted his experiences of the period in his revealing 1996 book, Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten (Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL).For a time, Dmytryk moved to England, and Stanley Kramer hired him to direct a trio of low-budget films before handing Dmytryk The Caine Mutiny. He made films for major studios Columbia, 20th Century Fox, MGM and Paramount Pictures, including, among others, Raintree County, The Left Hand of God, The Young Lions, a remake of the Marlene Dietrich classic The Blue Angel, and The Carpetbaggers. Later into the 60\u0027 and 70\u0027s, he directed Where Love Has Gone, Anzio, Alvarez Kelly, Shalako, and his final film Bluebeard. The films which he directed featured stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, Gene Tierney, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda.After his film career tapered off in the 1970s, he entered academia and taught at the University of Texas at Austin, and at the University of Southern California. He wrote several books on the art of filmmaking (such as \"On Film Editing\") and lectured at various colleges and theaters, such as the Orson Welles Cinema. Dmytryk died from heart and kidney failure on 1 July, 1999, aged 90, in Encino, California.",

Warner Bros. was sufficiently impressed by Powell\u0027s singing and stage presence to offer him a film contract in 1932. He made his film debut as a singing bandleader in Blessed Event. He went on to star as a boyish crooner in movie musicals such as 42nd Street, Footlight Parade, Gold Diggers of 1933, Dames, Flirtation Walk, and On the Avenue, often appearing opposite Ruby Keeler and Joan Blondell.Powell desperately wanted to expand his range but Warner Bros. wouldn\u0027t allow him to do so, although they did (mis)cast him in A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream (1935) as Lysander. This was to be Powell\u0027s only Shakespearean role and one he did not want to play, feeling that he was completely wrong for the part. Finally, reaching his forties and knowing that his young romantic leading man days were behind him he lobbied to play the lead in Double Indemnity. He lost out to Fred MacMurray, another Hollywood nice guy. MacMurray’s success, however, fueled Powell’s resolve to pursue projects with greater range and in 1944, he was cast in the first of a series of films noir, as private detective Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet, directed by Edward Dmytryk. The film was a big hit and Powell had successfully reinvented himself as a dramatic actor.The following year Dmytryk and Powell re-teamed to make Cornered, a gripping, post-WWII thriller that helped define the film noir style. He became a popular \"tough guy\" lead appearing in movies such as Johnny O\u0027Clock and Cry Danger. But 1948 saw him step out of the brutish type when he starred in Pitfall, a film noir that sees a bored insurance company worker fall for an innocent but dangerous femme fatale, played by Lizabeth Scott. Even when he appeared in lighter fare such as The Reformer and the Redhead and Susan Slept Here (1954) he never sang in his later roles. The latter, his final onscreen appearance in a feature film, did include a dance number with costar Debbie Reynolds.From 1949-1953, Powell played the lead role in the National Broadcasting Company radio theater production Richard Diamond, Private Detective. His character in the 30-minute weekly was a likable private detective with a quick wit. When Richard Diamond came to television in 1957, the lead role was portrayed by David Janssen.",

        "biography": "George Montgomery was boxing champion at the University of Montana,where he majored in architecture and interior design. Dropping out ayear later, he decided to take up boxing more seriously, and moved toCalifornia, where he was coached by ex-heavyweight world champion James J. Jeffries.While in Hollywood, he came to the attention of the studios (not least,because he was an expert rider) and was hired as a stuntman in 1935.After doing this for four years, George was offered a contract at 20thCentury Fox in 1939, but found himself largely confined to leads inB-westerns. He did not secure a part in anything even remotely like aprestige picture, until his co-starring role in Roxie Hart (1942), opposite Ginger Rogers. Next, in Orchestra Wives (1942), he played the perfunctory love interest for Ann Rutherford -- though both, inevitably, ended up playing second trombone to Glenn Miller and His Orchestra.In 1947, George got his first serious break, being cast as Raymond Chandler\u0027s private eye Philip Marlowe, in The Brasher Doubloon (1947). Reviewers, however, compared his performance unfavourably with that of Humphrey Bogartand found the film \u0027pallid\u0027 overall. So it was back to the saddle forGeorge. Unable to shake his image as a cowboy actor, he starred inscores of films with titles like Belle Starr\u0027s Daughter (1948), Dakota Lil (1950), Jack McCall Desperado (1953) and Masterson of Kansas (1954) at Columbia, and for producer Edward Smallat United Artists. When not cleaning up the Wild West with hissix-shooter, he branched out into adventure films set in exotic locales(notably as Harry Quartermain in Watusi(1959)). During the 60\u0027s, he also wrote, directed and starred inseveral long-forgotten, low-budget wartime potboilers made in thePhilippines.At the height of his popularity, George attracted asmuch publicity for his acting, as for his liaisons with glamorousstars, like Ginger Rogers, Hedy Lamarr (to whom he was briefly engaged) and singer Dinah Shore(whom he married in 1943). After his retirement from the film business,he devoted himself to his love of painting, furniture-making andsculpting bronze busts, including one of his close friend Ronald Reagan.",

Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years, but is best known for his cult hits The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) and The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976).Pierce was born in Hammond, Indiana, but moved to Arkansas early in his childhood. After working in production jobs at television stations, Pierce moved to Texarkana and started an advertising agency. He made his directorial debut with The Legend of Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by the legend of the Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The film was funded largely by a donation from an advertising client, and Pierce rented a local movie theater to exhibit it. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million.Pierce followed the success with several inexpensive, regional films set in Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Among them were The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana. Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s, when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact (1983). For that screenplay, he is said to have written the phrase, \"Go ahead, make my day,\" which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history.After years of pressure from producers, Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel, Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues (1985), which he considered the worst film of his career. The sequel was featured in a 1999 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, which ultimately increased Pierce\u0027s visibility. Pierce died of natural causes in Dover, Tennessee. His work has been cited as an influence on the horror film The Blair Witch Project (1999).Description above from the Wikipedia article Charles B.

He is widely considered by many commentators, critics, media and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of modern times, and a cultural icon. Lee was born in San Francisco to parents of Hong Kong heritage but was raised in Hong Kong until his late teens. Lee emigrated to the United States at the age of 18 to claim his U.S. citizenship and receive his higher education. It was during this time that he began teaching martial arts, which soon led to film and television roles. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, and sparked a major surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in Hong Kong and the rest of the world, as well. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei\u0027s The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Warner Brothers\u0027 Enter the Dragon (1973), directed by Robert Clouse; and Game of Death (1978), directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He initially trained in Wing Chun, but he later rejected well-defined martial art styles, favouring instead to utilise useful techniques from various sources in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist).Description above from the Wikipedia article Bruce Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

In 1915 he moved to Vienna, in 1919 to Bucharest, where he worked as a painter, before becoming a stage decorator in Paris. In 1927 he went to New York City for an exhibition of his paintings, and settled there.In 1934 he entered the film industry, first as a sketch artist, then as an assistant producer, second unit director and in the late 1930s he became a director and screenwriter. He made a reputation at Warner Brothers by directing short subjects, particularly a series of band shorts featuring unusual camera angles and dramatic use of shadows and silhouettes.Negulesco\u0027s first feature film as director was Singapore Woman (1941). In 1948 he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing for Johnny Belinda. In 1955, he won the BAFTA Award for Best Film for How to Marry a Millionaire. His 1959 movie, The Best of Everything, was on Entertainment Weekly\u0027s \"Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time\" list.From the late 1960s, he lived in Marbella, Spain where he died there at age 93, of heart failure.During his Hollywood career and in his 1984 autobiography, Negulesco claimed to have been born on 29 February 1900; he was apparently motivated to make this statement because birthdays on Leap Year Day are comparatively rare. In fact, 1900 was not a leap year, so there was no 29 February in 1900. Negulesco\u0027s autobiography (in which this claim appears) is appropriately titled Things I Did and Things I Think I Did.Description above from the Wikipedia article Jean Negulesco, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia​",

He is the son of director-producer Albert Band, and brother of the composer Richard Band. With his former wife Meda, he has two children, Alex Band, the vocalist for band The Calling, and Taryn Band. He has two sons with his former wife Debra Dion, Harlan and Zalman. Charles\u0027 grandfather was the artist Max Band.One of the few non-horror films he worked on was the Prehysteria trilogy, which were made by his family-oriented company Moonbeam Entertainment.His most famous films are those in the Puppet Master franchise, made by his Full Moon Features company. Before he had Full Moon Features, his earlier (and now defunct) company Empire Pictures made films like Ghoulies and Re-Animator.Starting in the seventies, Band formed Charles Band Productions. Dissatisfied with distributors\u0027 handling of his films, Band created Empire Pictures in the early eighties. Through Empire, he could produce and distribute his films ensuring proper distribution and return on profits. Empire entered the video market with Wizard Video during this time, which also released films by others in addition to Empire product. At the height of its run, Empire produced 12 theatrical and 12 direct to video films a year. Wizard would also produce two games for the Atari 2600 in 1982: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween both based on the films of the same names and both quite controversial at the time for the levels of violence. Citing the fall of the Italian lira, the Rome based Empire closed its doors in the late eighties and Band returned to the States. There he formed Full Moon Productions which was quickly changed to Full Moon Entertainment and later became Full Moon Studios and Full Moon Features before settling on the current Full Moon Pictures. During this time, Band produced exclusively with Paramount Home Video before parting ways with that company in 1994. Since then, Full Moon has been an independent company, producing and distributing solely for the home market. Notable side companies have included Moonbeam Entertainment, Filmonsters, Action Xtreme and Pulsepounders all of which produced films aimed at kids and tweens as well as Torchlight Entertainment and Surrender Cinema which produced soft core films for the adult market. In addition, Monster Island Entertainment produced man in a rubber suit monster movies, Alchemy Entertainment later Big City Pictures created urban horror, and Pulp Fantasy Productions specialized in non Full Moon type horror. For a short time in the early 2000s, Full Moon became Shadow Entertainment when Band felt the company\u0027s product had strayed too far from the brand that he had created. During this time, many of the films were produced by J. R. Bookwalter\u0027s Tempe Entertainment. Since 2004, Band has taken a more active hand in the company, producing and directing almost every film released. Also in 2004, the Wizard Video line was reintroduced.For a short time, fans could buy a line of toys based on characters from the films such as Shrieker, Radu from Subspecies and the Puppet Master puppets as well. Branded Full Moon Toys, this line lasted a couple of years. More recently, the Monster Bra line has been created, specializing in gag brassieres. CD soundtracks have also been released through the Full Moon Records line including many works by Band\u0027s brother Richard Band and comics based on Dollman, Puppet Master, Subspecies and Trancers were released through Eternity Comics.Description above from the Wikipedia article  Charles Robert Band, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.John Frederick Milius is an American screenwriter, director, and producer of motion pictures. He was one of the writers for the first two Dirty Harry films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of Apocalypse Now, and wrote and directed The Wind and the Lion, Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn.He wrote a number of iconic film lines such as \"Charlie don\u0027t surf\" and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" from Apocalypse Now, and the famous Dirty Harry one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including \"Go ahead, make my day\" and \"Ask yourself one question, \u0027do I feel lucky?\u0027 Well, do you, punk?\". Milius also wrote the USS Indianapolis monologue in the film Jaws; the sequence performed by Robert Shaw.After his work on Rough Riders (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in combat on San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: The Wind and the Lion (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film Rough Riders (where Tom Berenger took the role).The character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti was inspired by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, made by his friends the Coen Brothers, was partly based on Milius. The novella \"Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls\" by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as \"sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick.\"In 2013 a documentary about his life, titled Milius, was released.Writer Nat Segaloff called Milius:\"The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated—some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius\u0027 stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends...Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.\"Milius himself once said:\"Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don’t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what’s popular today [...] Write what you want to see. Because if you don’t, you’re not going to have any true passion in it, and it’s not going to be done with any true artistry.\"Description from the Wikipedia article John Milius, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Kenneth Tsang Kong (born 1938) is a Hong Kong actor. Tsang\u0027s career has spanned 50 years and included a variety of acting roles.Tsang was born in Hong Kong with family roots in Zhongshan, Guangdong. He attended high school in Texas, U.S. and received a degree in architecture from the University of California, Berkeley. He returned to Hong Kong in the early 1960s but was bored by the work. His older sister, Jeanette Lin Tsui  was a film star at the time and provided Tsang with several connections in the industry which boosted his acting career. In the media, Lin Tsui was always presented as Tsang\u0027s younger sister instead as it was moreover uncommon for female stars to reveal their age.Tsang\u0027s film debut was in the movie The Feud (1955), when he was just 16, which was followed by a role in Who Isn\u0027t Romantic? (1956). In the mid 1960s, Tsang starred in detective films and classic kung fu movies with (at the time) Hong Kong teen idols Connie Chan Po-chu and Josephine Siao. Tsang also appeared in a few Wong Fei-Hung movies in the late 1960s. In the 1986, Tsang worked as taxi cab owner, Ken, in John Woo\u0027s A Better Tomorrow. Subsequent collaborations with Woo included the role of Ken in A Better Tomorrow 2 in 1987, police officer Danny Lee\u0027s murdered partner in The Killer in 1989, and the strict adoptive father of Chow Yun-fat, Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung in Once a Thief in 1991.Tsang also filmed several Singaporean Chinese dramas during the 1990s, one of his most notable works there was the 1995 epic The Teochew Family and The Unbeatables IIUp to this point, Tsang had played roles in mainly Hong Kong movies. His first Hollywood film was The Replacement Killers (1998), also the Hollywood debut of co-star Chow Yun-fat. Tsang appeared alongside Chow once again in Anna and the King as well as Jackie Chan in Rush Hour 2. Tsang played General Moon in the James Bond film Die Another Day (2002), and he continues to appear in films from his native Hong Kong.Tsang is currently married to Jiao Jiao, a Chinese actress.Description above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Tsang, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

With Silent Light, Reygadas competed once more for the Palme d\u0027Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, and has become one of the most prominent writer/directors of modern cinema.Martin Scorsese called Silent Light \"A surprising picture, and a very moving one as well\".Description above from the Wikipedia article Carlos Reygadas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

        "biography": "Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, to Eliana and Eugène Van Varenberg, an accountant. \"The Muscles from Brussels\" started martial arts at the age of eleven. His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association\u0027s middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career.Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of 41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn\u0027t good enough to get anybody\u0027s attention. Then in 1984 he got a role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). But the movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star Jean-Claude Van Damme his good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), A.W.O.L.: Absent Without Leave (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife Gladys Portugues and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Derailed (2002), and In Hell (2003) which did averagely in box office terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in those movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in different action tones.",

Hellman is among a group of directing talent mentored by Roger Corman, who produced several of the director\u0027s early films. Hellman\u0027s most critically acclaimed film to date has been Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), a road movie that was a box office failure at the time of its initial release but has subsequently turned into a perennial cult favorite. Hellman\u0027s two acid westerns starring Jack Nicholson, Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting, both shot in 1965 and released directly to television in 1968, have also developed cult followings, particularly the latter. A third western, China 9, Liberty 37 (1978), was far less successful critically, although it too has its admirers, as do Cockfighter (1974) (aka Born to Kill)  and Iguana (1988). In 1989 he directed the straight-to-video slasher film Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!. In 2006, he directed \"Stanley\u0027s Girlfriend,\" a section of the omnibus horror film Trapped Ashes. Hellman\u0027s section of the film was presented by the Cannes Film Festival that year as an \"Official Selection\" and Hellman was named president of the Festival\u0027s \"Un Certain Regard\" jury. In 2009, he began production on a new feature film, the romantic film noir thriller, Road to Nowhere, which is scheduled to compete for the Golden Lion at the 67th Venice International Film Festival.

        "biography": "Wesley Ruggles (June 11, 1889 – January 8, 1972) was an American film director.He was born in Los Angeles, a younger brother of actor Charles Ruggles. He began his career in 1915 as an actor, appearing in a dozen or so silent films, on occasion with Charles Chaplin.In 1917, he turned his attention to directing, making more than 50 mostly forgettable films — including a silent film version of Edith Wharton\u0027s novel The Age of Innocence (1924) — before he won acclaim with Cimarron in 1931. The adaptation of Edna Ferber\u0027s novel Cimarron, about homesteaders settling in the prairies of Oklahoma, was the first Western to win an Academy Award as Best Picture.Although Ruggles followed this success with the light comedy No Man of Her Own (1932) with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, the comedy I\u0027m No Angel (1933) with Mae West and Cary Grant , College Humor (1933) with Bing Crosby, and Bolero (1934) with George Raft and Carole Lombard, few of his later films were in any way memorable (an exception is Arizona).His career was on the downslide when he teamed with the Rank Organisation in 1946 to produce and direct London Town with Sid Field and Petula Clark, based on a story he wrote. The film — British cinema\u0027s first attempt at a Technicolor musical extravaganza — is notable as being one of the biggest critical and commercial failures in that country\u0027s film history. Ironically, Ruggles had been hired to helm it because as an American, it was thought, he was better equipped to handle a musical — despite the fact that nothing in his past had prepared him to work in the genre. It was his last film. An abridged version was released in the U.S. under the title My Heart Goes Crazy by United Artists in 1953.Ruggles died in 1972 in Santa Monica and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.Description above from the Wikipedia article Wesley Ruggles, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie Evil Dead II with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi\u0027s Within the Woods, which served as a precursor to The Evil Dead.When Spiegel first moved to Los Angeles, he shared a house in with directors Raimi and Joel Coen, producer Ethan Coen and actresses Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand and Kathy Bates. He shared yet another house with roommate and film editor Bob Murawski (Spider-Man). In the early 1990s, he introduced film director Quentin Tarantino to producer Lawrence Bender, who helped Tarantino get Reservoir Dogs made.Spiegel grew up in what was then \"rural\" Birmingham, Michigan. He attended Walnut Lake Elementary school and then went on to attend West Maple Jr. High School. It was here that Scott met Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Spiegel worked at the local grocery market across from Walnut Lake Elementary School and it is from this market that Scott would later draw upon the memories to come up with classic scenes that would eventually be worked into many of the scenes of the movies he would either write or direct.In 1999, Spiegel directed the direct-to-video sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn, Texas Blood Money. Spiegel formed the production company Raw Nerve with film directors Eli Roth, and Boaz Yakin. Raw Nerve produced the film Hostel (2005), directed by Roth.Description above from the Wikipedia article Scott Spiegel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gallo was a painter in the New York City art scene showing with famed art dealer Annina Nosei, performed in a rap duo and was part of the first hip hop television broadcast Graffiti Rock, and played in an industrial band called Bohack which released an album title It Took Several Wives.In the early 2000s, he released several solo recordings on WARP records. Gallo is known for his outspoken views and generally sarcastic nature, once stating: \"I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings; and I did it out of spite.\" Gallo was awarded the Coppa Volpi for Best Actor at the 67th Venice International Film Festival for his performance as a wordless escaping Muslim prisoner in Jerzy Skolimowski\u0027s Essential Killing. His own feature film Promises Written In Water, which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in, also screened In Competition at the festival.",

A 7th-dan black belt in Aikido, Seagal began his adult life as an Aikido instructor in Japan. He became the first foreigner to operate an Aikido Dojo in Japan.He later moved to the Los Angeles, California, area where he made his film debut in 1988 in Above the Law. By 1991, he had starred in three successful films, and would go on to achieve greater fame in Under Siege (1992), where he played Navy SEALs counter-terrorist expert Casey Ryback. However, his image became tarnished when both On Deadly Ground (1994, which he directed) and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995) did poorly in theaters. During the later half of the 90s, he starred in three more theatrical films and a direct-to-video The Patriot. Aside from Exit Wounds (2001) and Half Past Dead (2002), his career shifted almost entirely to direct-to-video films (often low budget productions and shot in Europe or Asia). Between 1998 to 2009, he appeared in a total of 22 of these. At the age of 59, he finally returned to the big screen as Torrez in the 2010 film Machete. As of 2011, he\u0027s currently busy with the third season of his reality show Steven Seagal: Lawman.Seagal is also a recording artist and guitarist and the founder of Steven Seagal Enterprises. In addition to his professional achievements, he is also known as an environmentalist, an animal rights activist and a supporter of the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, and the Tibetan independence movement.Description above from the Wikipedia article Steven Seagal, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

His books have sold over 150 million copies worldwide, and many have been adapted into films. In 1994, Crichton became the only creative artist ever to have works simultaneously charting at #1 in television, film, and book sales (with ER, Jurassic Park, and Disclosure, respectively).His literary works are usually based on the action genre and heavily feature technology. His novels epitomize the techno-thriller genre of literature, often exploring technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with biotechnology. Many of his future history novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and science background. He was the author of, among others, Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Travels, Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure, The Lost World, Airframe, Timeline, Prey, State of Fear, Next (the final book published before his death), Pirate Latitudes (published November 24, 2009), and a final unfinished techno-thriller yet to be released. Forbes listed Crichton in tenth place in its list of \"Top-Earning Dead Celebrities\" of 2009.Description above from the Wikipedia article Michael Crichton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He entered films in the 1920s and began directing in 1928. His films often were cheerier than most Russian films as he was influenced by American slapstick, among other things. However he also did serious historical films, docudramas, and biopics.He won Cannes\u0027s Best Director Award twice: for Othello in 1956 and for Lenin in Poland in 1966.

John L. Barrett played The Lone Ranger on test broadcasts of the series in early January 1933, but when the program became part of the regular schedule Seaton was cast in the title role. In later years he claimed to have devised the cry \"Hi-yo, Silver\" because he couldn\u0027t whistle for his horse as the script required.Seaton joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a contract writer in 1933. His first major screen credit was the Marx Brothers comedy A Day at the Races in 1937. In the early 1940s he joined 20th Century Fox, where he remained for the rest of the decade, writing scripts for Moon Over Miami, Coney Island, Charley\u0027s Aunt, The Song of Bernadette, and others before making his directorial debut with Diamond Horseshoe in 1945. From this point on he was credited as both screenwriter and director for most of his films, including The Shocking Miss Pilgrim, Miracle on 34th Street, Apartment for Peggy, Chicken Every Sunday, The Big Lift, For Heaven\u0027s Sake, Little Boy Lost, The Country Girl, and The Proud and Profane.But Not Goodbye, Seaton\u0027s 1944 Broadway debut as a playwright, closed after only 23 performances, although it later was adapted for the 1946 film The Cockeyed Miracle by Karen DeWolf. In 1967 he returned to Broadway to direct the Norman Krasna play Love in E Flat, which was a critical and commercial flop. The musical Here\u0027s Love, adapted from his screenplay for Miracle on 34th Street by Meredith Willson, proved to be more successful.Seaton won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay twice, for Miracle on 34th Street (which also earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay) and The Country Girl, and was nominated for Oscars three additional times. He received The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1961.Seaton died of cancer in Beverly Hills, California.Description above from the Wikipedia article George Seaton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He began directing silent movies in 1917 and went on to helm 107 films, 40 of them silent. Although most of Neill\u0027s films were for the most part low-budget B-movies, he was known for directing films with meticulously lit scenes with carefully layered shadows that would become the style of film noir in the late 1940s. In fact, his last film, Black Angel (1946), is considered a film noir.He was also credited in some works as R. William Neill, Roy W. Neill, and Roy Neill. Neill lived in the United States for most of his career and was a U.S. citizen. He did go to London from 1935 until 1940 where better opportunities existed for American directors. During this period, British film producer Edward Black hired Neill to direct The Lady Vanishes. However, due to delays in production, Black hired Alfred Hitchcock to direct instead.Neill died in London, England from a heart attack.Description above from the Wikipedia article Roy William Neill, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Marcel Carné (August 18, 1906 – October 31, 1996) was a French film director.Born in Paris, France, the son of a cabinet maker whose wife died when their son was five, Carné began his career as a film critic, becoming editor of the weekly publication, Hebdo-Films, and working for Cinémagazine and Cinémonde between 1929 and 1933. In the same period he worked in silent film as a camera assistant with director Jacques Feyder. By age 25, Carné had already directed his first short film, Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche (1929). He assisted Feyder (and René Clair) on several films through to La kermesse héroïque (1935).Feyder accepted an invitation to work in England for Alexander Korda, for whom he made Knight Without Armour (1937), but made it possible for Carné to take over his project, Jenny (1936), as its director.[4] The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with surrealist poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert. This collaborative relationship lasted for more than a dozen years, during which Carné and Prévert created their best remembered films. Together, they were involved in the poetic realism film movement of fatalistic tragedies.Under the German occupation of France during World War II, Carné worked in the Vichy zone where he subverted the regime\u0027s attempts to control art; several of his team were Jewish, including Joseph Kosma and set designer Alexandre Trauner. Under difficult conditions they made Carné\u0027s most highly regarded film Les Enfants du paradis (Children of Paradise, 1945) released after the Liberation of France. In the late 1990s, the film was voted \"Best French Film of the Century\" in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals. Post war, he and Prévert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, titled Les Portes de la nuit, was panned by the critics and a box office failure and was their last completed film.By the 1950s, Carné\u0027s reputation was in eclipse. The critics of Cahiers du Cinema, who became the film makers of the New Wave, dismissed him and placed his film\u0027s merits solely with Prevert. Other than his 1958 hit Les Tricheurs, Carné\u0027s postwar films met with only uneven success and many were greeted by an almost unrelenting negative criticism from the press and within members of the film industry. In 1958, Carné was the Head of the Jury at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival. Carné made his last film in 1976.Carné was gay and made little secret about it. Several of his later films contain references to male homosexuality or bisexuality. His one-time partner was Roland Lesaffre who appeared in many of his films.In 1989 a book was published by Edward Baron Turk as part of the Harvard Film Studies that told his story under the title Child of Paradise: Marcel Carné and the Golden Age of French Cinema.Marcel Carné died in 1996 in Clamart, Hauts-de-Seine, and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in Montmartre.Description above from the Wikipedia article Marcel Carné, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Growing up in North Bergen, New Jersey, Brooks endured a fractured family life and passed the time by reading and writing. After dropping out of New York University, he got a job as an usher at CBS, going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper\u0027s documentaries. After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him a job as a writer on the series My Mother the Car.Brooks wrote for several shows before being hired as a story editor on My Friend Tony and later creating the series Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and Burns at MTM Productions to create The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970. The show, one of the first to feature an independent working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several Primetime Emmy Awards. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs from Mary Tyler Moore in the shape of Rhoda (a comedy) and Lou Grant (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom Taxi which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.He moved into feature film work when he wrote and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the critically acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three positions. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I\u0027ll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, which came in the shape of 2004\u0027s Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).Although he did not intend to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of The Tracey Ullman Show. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running after 20 years. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.Description above from the Wikipedia article James L. Brooks, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Lawrence has written films such as The Out-of-Towners (1999), Miss Congeniality (2000), and Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005). He has both written and directed Two Weeks Notice (2002), Music and Lyrics (2007), and most recently, Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009), all starring Hugh Grant. A good way of getting an insight into Marc Lawrence\u0027s iterative approach to screenwriting and production is to play the relevant \"extras\" on the DVDs of some of the aforementioned movies. These commentaries demonstrate interesting insights into the productive nature of the interaction between actors, producers, director and screenwriter, and Mr Lawrence is quick to commend the impromptu, unscripted contributions of others. Donald Petrie\u0027s commentary on \"Miss Congeniality\" commends Mr Lawrence more highly than he commends himself in the thoroughly entertaining commentary he made with Sandra Bullock for the same film.Description above from the Wikipedia article Marc Lawrence (filmmaker), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

        "biography": "Samuel Michael Fuller (August 12, 1912 – October 30, 1997) was an American screenwriter, novelist and film director known for low-budget genre movies with controversial themes.He was born Samuel Michael Fuller in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Benjamin Rabinovitch, a Jewish immigrant  from Russia, and Rebecca Baum, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. After immigrating to America, the family\u0027s surname was changed from Rabinovitch to \"Fuller\" possibly by inspiration of a Doctor who arrived in America on the Mayflower.  At the age of 12, he began working in journalism  as a newspaper  copyboy. He became a crime reporter  in New York City at age 17, working for the New York Evening Graphic. He broke the story of Jeanne Eagels\u0027 death.  He wrote pulp novels and screenplays  from the mid-1930s onwards. Fuller also became a screenplay  ghostwriter  but would never tell interviewers which screenplays that he ghost-wrote explaining \"that\u0027s what a ghost writer is for\".During World War II, Fuller joined the United States Army infantry. He was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and saw heavy fighting. He was involved in landings in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy  and also saw action in Belgium and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was present at the liberation of the German concentration camp at Falkenau  and shot 16 mm footage which was used later in the documentary Falkenau: The Impossible. For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart.  Fuller used his wartime experiences as material in his films, especially in The Big Red One (1980), a nickname of the 1st Infantry Division.After his controversial film \"White Dog\" was shelved by Paramount pictures, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film. Fuller eventually returned to America. He died of natural causes in his California home. In November 1997, the Directors Guild held a three hour memorial in his honor, hosted by Curtis Hanson, his long time friend and co-writer on White Dog. He was survived by his wife Christa and daughter Samantha.",

A figure in the post-war New Wave cinema, he was a former editor of Cahiers du cinéma.Rohmer was the last of the French New Wave directors to become established. He worked as the editor of the Cahiers du cinéma periodical from 1957 to 1963, while most of his Cahiers colleagues – among them Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut – were beginning their careers and gaining international attention. René Schérer, a philosopher, is his brother and René Monzat, a journalist, is his son.Rohmer came to international attention around 1969 when his film Ma nuit chez Maud (My Night at Maud\u0027s) was nominated at the Academy Awards. He won the San Sebastián International Film Festival with Claire\u0027s Knee in 1971. In 2001, Rohmer received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. His works were viewed by audiences around the world. He died of unspecified causes on 11 January 2010. In his obituary in The Daily Telegraph he was described as \"the most durable film-maker of the French New Wave\", outlasting his peers and \"still making movies the public wanted to see\" late in his career.Description above from the Wikipedia article Éric Rohmer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Milton Menasco (January 22, 1890 – June 7, 1974) was an American painter and art director of silent movies born in Los Angeles, California.Born in 1890 in Los Angeles, California, Menasco began his art career in the early days of Hollywood and described his work then as the \"blood and thunder\" posters which enticed movie fans into theaters to watch the first silent pictures. He was commissioned for mural paintings at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco for the World\u0027s Fair in 1915.His vivid use of colors and graphics won him recognition in Hollywood, where he worked on 33 films--29 times as art director and twice as set director. In 1925 he was the architecture and set director for the original film based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u0027s The Lost World. This film received accolades for its innovative art direction and special effects. To quote one review in the NewTimes: \"And while Harry O. Hoyt is credited as director, a host of fellow auteurs must take credit for Lost World\u0027s still impressive thrills, especially the effects work of Willis O\u0027Brien (who would later animate King Kong in 1933) and the wild set design from Milton Menasco.\" A complete list of Menasco\u0027s film credits is given here.In 1925 Menasco went to New York City as art director for a film making company and turned to advertising. He also painted portraits and water colors of horses and ships during this time which he sold in the City\u0027s galleries. During World War II, Life magazine commissioned him to draw air and sea battles to chronicle the war in Europe and in the Pacific Theater.After the war, Mr. Menasco moved to Kentucky to devote himself entirely to his real love, horse portraiture. Here he painted the equine racing greats of the nation and helped with art direction at the Thoroughbred Record and Sporting News. He and his wife purchased a farm where an old brick house built in the 18th Century served for many years as his studio.Horsemen admired the richness and feeling reflected in Menasco\u0027s paintings, and his clients included John Hay Whitney, Isabel Dodge Sloane, President Ronald Reagan and Allaire du Pont. One of his first large paintings was for Lucille Markey depicting nine of her horses at Calumet Farm including Citation, Coaltown and others grouped in the track with exercise boys up. He also painted Secretariat for owner, Penny Chenery.In 1953 Menasco painted the famous broodmare La Troienne in a work titled \"La Troienne and Her Foals\": Eighteen Vignettes and One Painting Together in One Frame\" for John Whitney. The painting was exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1999 it sold from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney through Sotheby\u0027s auction house for £74,000 (c. US$120,000).In 1957, Menasco painted Doubledogdare and Delta for Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. The artist explained that although the actual painting had taken him about three months to complete, \"behind it goes all the training, study and experience of my life.\"A distinguishing mark of Menasco\u0027s paintings is the detail to sky and landscape backgrounds. A perfect example of this detail is apparent in Nashua, with Eddie Arcaro up, painted by Menasco at Hialeah Park for Leslie Combs II. The background shows the track and a ring of palm trees.Milton Menasco died in 1974 of a heart attack at his farm in Versailles, Kentucky.Description above from the Wikipedia article Milton Menasco,   licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was born in Maida Vale, a district of London, England.Fisher was one of the most prominent horror directors of the second half of the 20th century. He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour, and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films, while mild by modern standards, were unprecedented in his day. His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), which launched Hammer\u0027s long association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film a number of adaptations of classic horror subjects, including Dracula (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959) and The Mummy (1959).Given their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher\u0027s films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right. His films are characterised by a blend of fairy-tale, myth and sexuality. They draw heavily on Christian themes, and there is usually a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason, in contrast to other characters, who are either blindly superstitious or bound by a cold, godless rationalism (as noted by critic Paul Leggett in Terence Fisher: Horror, Myth and Religion, 2001).

        "biography": "Abel Gance was a French film director, producer, writer and actor. A pioneer in the theory and practice of montage, he is best known for three major silent films: J\u0027accuse (1919), La Roue (1923), and Napoléon (1927).He was born in Paris in 1889. In 1909, he acted in his first film. He also wrote scenarios, and often sold them to Gaumont. During this period he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, fatal at the time, but he recovered. In 1911, with some friends he established a production company, Le Film Français, and began directing his own films.With the outbreak of WW I, rejected by the army on medical grounds, he started writing and directing for a new film company, Film d\u0027Art until 1918, making over a dozen successful films. Charles Pathé underwrote his next film, J\u0027accuse (1919), in which Gance confronted the waste and suffering which the war had brought.In 1920, he developed La Roue. He brought an unprecedented level of energy and imagination to the technical realization of his story, employing elaborate editing techniques and innovative use of rapid cutting which made the film highly influential. The finished film ran for nearly nine hours, but was edited down for distribution.In 1921, Gance visited America to promote J\u0027accuse. He met D. W. Griffith, whom he had long admired. He was also offered a contract with MGM but turned it down.He then embarked on his greatest project, a six-part life of Napoléon. Only the first part was completed, tracing his early life, through the Revolution, up to the invasion of Italy, but even this occupied a vast canvas with meticulously recreated historical scenes and scores of characters. The film was full of experimental techniques, combining rapid cutting, hand-held cameras, superimposition of images, and, in wide-screen sequences, shot using a system he called Polyvision needing triple cameras (and projectors), achieved a spectacular panoramic effect, including a finale in which the outer two film panels were tinted blue and red, creating a widescreen image of a French flag. The original version ran for around 6 hours. A shortened version received a triumphant première at the Paris Opéra in April 1927.Throughout his life he kept returning to Napoléon, editing his footage, and as a result the original 1927 film was lost from view for decades. The dedicated work of the film historian Kevin Brownlow produced a five-hour version, still incomplete but fuller than anyone had seen since the 1920s. It was presented at the Telluride Film Festival in 1979, and the occasion brought a belated triumph to Gance\u0027s career, and made his name known to a worldwide audience.In the assessment of Kevin Brownlow, \"...[Abel Gance] made a fuller use of the medium than anyone before or since\". As well as his multiscreen ventures with Polyvision, he explored the use of superimposition of images, extreme close-ups, fast rhythmic editing, and he made the camera mobile in unorthodox ways – hand-held, mounted on wires or a pendulum, or even strapped to a horse. He also made early experiments with the addition of sound to film, and with filming in color and in 3-D. There were few aspects of film technique that he did not seek to incorporate in his work, and his influence was acknowledged by contemporaries and later by the French New Wave film-makers.",

Karlson directed 99 River Street, Kansas City Confidential and Hell\u0027s Island all with actor John Payne in the early 1950s. Other films include Rocky (1948), The Phenix City Story (1955), 5 Against the House (1955) and The Young Doctors (1961).Phil Karlson was the son of popular Irish actress Lillian O\u0027Brien.He studied painting at Chicago\u0027s Art Institute, and law, at his father\u0027s request, at Loyola Marymount University in California.Karlson got into the film industry working as a prop man while a law student. After working a number of film jobs, including being an assistant director for a number of Abbott and Costello films, Karlson directed his first film in 1944 and in 1948 directed the first film starring Marilyn Monroe, Ladies of the Chorus. He worked on a number of low-budget projects for Monogram Pictures and Eagle-Lion Films before making his mark in 1950. It was then that he was known for directing tough, realistic and sometimes violent gritty crime films. In the 1960s the quality of his directed films declined, which included working on Kid Galahad (1962) with Elvis Presley and two Dean Martin Matt Helm spy films, including The Wrecking Crew (1969) co-starring Sharon Tate and Elke Sommer. He had his biggest success in 1973 when he directed the hit film, Walking Tall. The film made the director a rich man many times over, thanks to the fact that he owned a huge part of the movie.Description above from the Wikipedia article Phil Karlson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

When visiting a friend on a film set, he saw that the director had a problem in setting up a shot; Sandrich offered his advice. It worked. He then entered into the movies in the prop department, and became a director specializing in several comedy shorts in 1927. He then made his first feature the next year, but returned to shorts after the sound arrival. In 1933 he directed the Academy Award-winning short, So This Is Harris!. He later returned to feature films, most notably comedies, starring the team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in Hips, Hips, Hooray!. In 1934, Sandrich soon got his first directing assignment on the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical The Gay Divorcee, which proved a success.The following year, he directed what is widely regarded as the best movie ever made by the legendary dance team, Top Hat, which excelled in every department, including music and choreography. It was all pulled together seamlessly by Sandrich. After that, several other movies such as Follow the Fleet, Shall We Dance, and Carefree followed. In 1940, Sandrich left RKO for Paramount, which offered him a chance to be not only a director but as well as a producer. He made other several successful films in this capacity, including two with Jack Benny, Buck Benny Rides Again and Love Thy Neighbor, both released in 1940, and the romantic comedy Skylark, starring Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland. However, while all these were hits, it was Holiday Inn in 1942 starring Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, with music by Irving Berlin that showed Sandrich at his best. The musical/comedy actually started on the eve of America\u0027s entry into World War II. It featured sufficient serious overtones to capture the mood of the time, and showed Crosby and Astaire to brilliant advantage as performers who are rivals for the same woman; and it introduced the song \"White Christmas\", highlighted by the crooner Crosby which remained the biggest selling popular song in history for fifty-two years. So Proudly We Hail! was a Sandrich-produced and directed adaptation of the hit play. It was extremely popular and successful, and featured a pair of performers – Adrian Booth and George Reeves -- whom Sandrich had intended to bring to stardom after the war. However, it wasn\u0027t to be.In 1945, while in pre-production on a follow up to Holiday Inn called Blue Skies, starring Bing Crosby and featuring Irving Berlin\u0027s music, and serving as president of the Directors Guild, Sandrich died suddenly, of heart failure. He was at this time one of the most trusted and influential directors in Hollywood, respected by his colleagues and the studio management. His sons Mark Sandrich Jr. and Jay Sandrich have gone onto successful careers as directors. His interment was located at Home of Peace Cemetery.Description above from the Wikipedia article Mark Sandrich, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1941 he won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Great McGinty.Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations.In recent years, film scholars such as Alessandro Pirolini have also argued that Sturges\u0027 cinema anticipated more experimental narratives by contemporary directors such as Joel and Ethan Coen, Robert Zemeckis, and Woody Allen, along with prolific The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder: \"Many of [Sturges\u0027] movies and screenplays reveal a restless and impatient attempt to escape codified rules and narrative schemata, and to push the mechanisms and conventions of their genre to the extent of unveiling them to the spectator. [See for example] the disruption of standardized timelines in films such as The Power and the Glory and The Great McGinty [or the way] an apparently classical comedy such as Unfaithfully Yours (1948) shifts into the realm of multiple and hypothetical narratives.Prior to Sturges, other figures in Hollywood (such as Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts. However, Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to be initially mainly successfully established as a screenwriter and then to subsequently move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were mostly entrenched and separate. Famously, Sturges sold the story for The Great McGinty to Paramount Pictures for $1, in return for being allowed to direct the film; the sum was quietly raised to $10 by the studio for legal reasons.Description above from the Wikipedia article Preston Sturges, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He then went on to direct a series of successful and critically acclaimed feature films, which he produced himself (a rare risk in the French cinema landscape).Alain Jessua is regularly honored in France and abroad. His short film Léon la lune was screened at the MOMA - Museum of Modern Art in New York a few years ago and Martin Scorsese cited La Vie à l\u0027envers as one of the films that really made an impact on him.

His best-remembered role may be that of hapless flower shop owner Gravis Mushnik in the 1960 low-budget Roger Corman dark comedy, The Little Shop of Horrors (which featured Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient).Not much is known of Welles\u0027 early life, except that he was born Ira Meltcher in New York City. He graduated from Mt. Carmel High School, in 1940. He went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Penn State University, a Master of Arts degree from West Virginia University, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University.Welles held a number of jobs during his lifetime; at one time or another he worked as a clinical psychologist, radio DJ, television actor, writer and film director. He did some stage work before traveling to Hollywood, where in 1953 he appeared in his first film, Appointment in Honduras. His favorite role (The Little Shop of Horrors) was also his last in the U.S. for many years.In the early 1960s, he left the United States to act, produce and direct primarily in European film productions including the cult horror films Maneater of Hydra (1967) and Lady Frankenstein (1971). His fluency in five languages proved to be most helpful. He also served as a film consultant. Later he returned to the U.S., appearing in a number of films, doing voice work, and teaching voice acting.Probably his most widely seen work in the late 1970\u0027s was his English adaptation of the Japanese television show, \"Spectreman\" which was seen on UHF and cable across the United States. While he shares writing credit with two other people, it\u0027s clear that most of the English voice work, and the offbeat humor, is his.In 1998, Welles took to the stage in a community theater production of Little Shop of Horrors (musical) as Mushnik, the role he created in the original Roger Corman film. Welles had never performed in the musical and was happy to be asked to do the role, which he described as a \"mitzvah\" for Scotts Valley Performing Arts. Jonathan Haze, who played Seymour in the original film, attended the opening, and Welles also received a visit from Martin P. Robinson, the designer of the Audrey II plant puppets used in the off-Broadway production (Robinson is also famous for his puppetry on Sesame Street).Welles was working on a horror screenplay, tentatively titled House of a Hundred Horrors, at the time of his death.Description above from the Wikipedia article Mel Welles, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was one of Hollywood\u0027s most prolificdirectors, turning out films in remarkable numbers and in a wide variety ofgenres.In 1915 he was hired as an actor and director by the KalemCompany. He was an assistant to director D.W. Griffith on The Birth of a Nationand Intolerance. By the time he was 23 Beaudine had directed his first picture,a short called Almost a King (1915). He would continue to direct shortsexclusively until 1922, when he shifted his efforts into making feature-lengthfilms.Beaudine directed silent films for Goldwyn Pictures (beforeit became part of MGM), Metro Pictures (also before MGM), First NationalPictures, Principal and Warner Brothers. In 1926 he made Sparrows, the story oforphans imprisoned in a swamp farm starring Mary Pickford. Beaudine had atleast 30 pictures to his credit before the sound era began. Among his firstsound films were short Mack Sennett comedies; he made at least one film forSennett while contractually bound elsewhere, resulting in his adopting thepseudonym \"William Crowley.\" He would occasionally use the pseudonymin later years, usually as \"William X. Crowley.\"He ground out several movies annually for Fox Films, WarnerBrothers, Paramount, and Universal Pictures. His most famous credit of theearly 1930s is The Old-Fashioned Way, a comedy about old-time show folksstarring W. C. Fields.Beaudine was one of a number of experienced directors(including Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan) who were brought to England fromHollywood in the 1930s to work on what were in all other respects very Britishproductions. Beaudine directed four films there starring Will Hay, includingBoys Will Be Boys (1935) and Where There\u0027s a Will (1936).Beaudine was often entrusted with series films, includingthe Torchy Blane, The East Side Kids, Jiggs and Maggie, The Shadow, CharlieChan and The Bowery Boys series. His efficiency was so well known that WaltDisney hired him to direct some of his television projects of the 1950s and hadhim direct a feature western, Ten Who Dared (1960). Beaudine became even busierin TV, directing Naked City, The Green Hornet, and dozens of Lassie episodes.His last two feature films, both released in 1966, were thehorror-westerns Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (with John Carradine) and Jesse JamesMeets Frankenstein\u0027s Daughter. By the end of the decade he was the industry\u0027soldest working professional, having started in 1909.Beaudine died of uremic poisoning in 1970 in California andwas interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood.",

While at Reed, Vamos organized a student group called Guerrilla Theater of the Absurd. They performed and documented \"culture jamming\" acts of protest, including Reverse Peristalsis Painters, where 24 people in suits stood outside the downtown venue of Dan Quayle\u0027s fundraiser for Oregon senator Bob Packwood and drank ipecac, forcing themselves to vomit the red, white and blue remains of the mashed potatoes and food coloring they had consumed earlier; and a middle of the night contribution to the debate over re-naming Portland\u0027s Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, wherein the city awoke to find that all of the street signs and freeway exits for another major boulevard had been changed to read \"Malcolm X Street.\"Another successful early project was the \"Barbie Liberation Organization,\" where Vamos and his cohorts purchased three hundred Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls, exchanged their electronic voice boxes, and then returned them to the stores; the soldiers ended up saying things like \"Let\u0027s go shopping!\", while the Barbies exclaimed \"Vengeance is mine!\".

Already in the 70s he followed the same modus operandi, this time in British low-budget productions. Artisan of limited skills and without overly relevant in his curriculum title, throughout his career he also showed a sense of opportunism with productions such as \u0027The Vampire motorway\u0027 (1969), horror film inspired by a series of real murders occurred in the Spain of the time, and \u0027The hyena\u0027 (1973); \u0027Last Tango in Madrid\u0027 (1975), comic byproduct trying to bring revenues to the success of \u0027Last Tango in Paris\u0027 (1972) by Bernardo Bertolucci; or \u0027Command Txiquia - Death of a President\u0027 (1977), reconstruction of the terrorist attack that would end the life of Admiral Carrero Blanco, filmed without permission in the same places where the events occurred, with which anticipated the celebrated \u0027Operation Ogre\u0027 (1979) by Gillo Pontecorvo.- IMDb Mini Biography By: jsanchez",

While D\u0027Amato contributed to many different genres (such as the spaghetti western, the war movie, the swashbuckler, the peplum, and the fantasy film), the majority of his films are exploitation-themed pornography, both soft- and hardcore. He is perhaps most well known for his horror film efforts, many of which went on to become cult movies (such as Anthropophagous and Beyond the Darkness), and for his hastily-produced remakes of popular American films (such as the Ator series, based upon the Conan the Barbarian films), some of which were featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000. The poor production value of many of his films, combined with his expressed lack of concern for the production quality of his films as long as they proved profitable, have led him to be labeled as \"The Evil Ed Wood,\" despite D\u0027Amato\u0027s apparently amiable nature.Description above from the Wikipedia article Joe D\u0027Amato, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia​",

His second feature The Devil (1972) was banned in Poland, and Żuławski went to France. After the success of That Most Important Thing: Love in 1975, he returned to Poland where he spent two years in making The Silver Globe (1988). The work on this film was interrupted by the Polish authorities. After that, Zulawski moved to France where became known for controversial and violent art-house films.

He is known for his pioneering work in television and film and for his controversial style. He has been criticized as being over-obsessed with sexuality and the church. His subject matter is often about famous composers, or based on other works of art which he adapts loosely. Russell began directing for the BBC, where he did creative adaptations of composers\u0027 lives which were unusual for the time. He also directed many feature films independently and for studios.He is best known for his Oscar-winning film Women in Love (1969), The Devils (1971), The Who\u0027s Tommy (1975), and the science fiction film Altered States (1980).One noted admirer, the British film critic Mark Kermode, attempting to sum up the director\u0027s achievement, called Russell; \"somebody who proved that British cinema didn\u0027t have to be about kitchen-sink realism - it could be every bit as flamboyant as Fellini. He now makes very strange experimental films like Lion\u0027s Mouth and Revenge of the Elephant Man, and they are as edgy and out there as the work he made in the 1970s.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Ken Russell, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

After graduating, Gary moved to London, England, where he continued directing commercials and also co-wrote and directed his first feature film, Death Line starring Donald Pleasence. The British Film Institute called this debut \"The Most Significant Directorial Debut of the Year\".Upon relocating to Los Angeles, California, he continued writing and collaborating on many feature scripts. He also wrote and directed several television pilots. Avco-Embassy producer Ronald Shusett asked Sherman to direct the 1981 horror film Dead \u0026 Buried, and Sherman followed that film with the action-thriller Vice Squad shot by Stanley Kubrick\u0027s DP John Alcott. Like Death Line, these films often polarized critics and audiences and have since gone on to become genre classics.Next he co-wrote and directed the thriller Wanted: Dead or Alive starring Rutger Hauer and Gene Simmons. Teamed with Gene, the award-winning Rock Against Drugs public service campaign for MTV came about as well as the pilot for the ABC series Sable.Description above from the Wikipedia article Gary Sherman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "René Clair was a French filmmaker and writer. He first established his reputation in the 1920s as a director of silent films in which comedy was often mingled with fantasy. He went on to make some of the most innovative early sound films in France, before going abroad to work in the UK and USA for more than a decade. Returning to France after World War II, he continued to make films that were characterised by their elegance and wit, often presenting a nostalgic view of French life in earlier years. He was elected to the Académie française in 1960. Clair\u0027s best known films include The Italian Straw Hat (1928), Under the Roofs of Paris (1930), Le Million (1931), À nous la liberté (1931), I Married a Witch (1942), and And Then There Were None (1945).In 1924, while Clair was working on Ciné-sketch for the theatre with France Picabia, he first met a young actress, Bronja Perlmutter, who subsequently appeared in his film Le Voyage imaginaire (1926) premiered at the newly opened Studio des Ursulines. They married in 1926, and their son, Jean-François, was born in 1927.René Clair died at home on 15 March 1981, and he was buried privately at Saint-Germain-l\u0027Auxerrois.Clair\u0027s reputation as a film-maker underwent a considerable reevaluation during the course of his own lifetime: in the 1930s he was widely seen as one of France\u0027s greatest directors, alongside Renoir and Carné, but thereafter his work\u0027s artifice and detachment from the realities of life fell increasingly from favour. The avant-gardism of his first films, and especially Entr\u0027acte, had given him a temporary notoriety, and a grounding in surrealism continued to underlie much of his comedy work. It was however the imaginative manner in which he overcame his initial scepticism about the arrival of sound which established his originality, and his first four sound films brought him international fame.Clair\u0027s years of working in the UK and USA made him still more widely known but did not show any marked development in his style or thematic concerns. It was in the post-war films that he made on his return to France that some critics have observed a new maturity and emotional depth, accompanied by a prevailing sense of melancholy but still framed by the elegance and wit that characterised his earlier work.However, in the 1950s the critics who heralded the arrival of the French New Wave, especially those associated with Cahiers du Cinéma, found Clair\u0027s work old-fashioned and academic. The paradox of Clair\u0027s reputation has been further heightened by those commentators who have seen François Truffaut as the French cinema\u0027s true successor to Clair, notwithstanding the occasions of their mutual disdain.",

Using the centre\u0027s facilities, he was a very prolific director of video dramas and collaborated with a number of other directors in different roles including cameraman. A major influence was the centre\u0027s video maker, Dermot Byrne with whom he worked on a number of projects. It was at 33 that he met the future film composer David Arnold who played in a band that rehearsed there. Cannon convinced Arnold that he could compose soundtracks for his and other people\u0027s videos. Arnold\u0027s first but not the last soundtrack for Byrne was \u0027The Undead\u0027 written by Keith Moyes.In 1987 Cannon, then a teenager, entered a competition in the British comic 2000 AD to design a poster for a possible future film of Judge Dredd. His work was published in the comic\u0027s \"Prog 534\" edition. In his poster, a clearly Blade Runner–inspired Cannon imagined that the director of the film would be Ridley Scott, with Harrison Ford starring in the title role and Daryl Hannah co-starring as \"PSI Anderson\".By 1987 he was awarded the BBC Young Filmmaker of the Year Award for a 40-minute short called Sometimes. He enrolled at the National Film and Television School in 1988, from which he graduated in 1990.He wrote and directed Strangers (1990) and The Young Americans (1993), the latter having as its title song, \"Play Dead\", sung by Icelandic diva Björk. Based on his work on the later gangster film, producers signed him to direct the big-budget, but ultimately poorly received film Judge Dredd (1995), starring Sylvester Stallone. Since then he has also directed Phoenix (1998), and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998). Beginning in 2000, he has directed and produced various CSI television series. In 2005 he directed Goal!. Cannon also plays football regularly with Hollywood United F.C. The team mostly features celebrities and former professional footballers. They do however, occasionally play against professional teams for friendly matches and charity events.He directed a 2006 CBS television pilot, Capital Law, about a group of legal associates trying to make partner at a powerful Washington, D.C.–based law firm. More recently, Cannon co-created TNT\u0027s crime drama series starring Dylan McDermott, called Dark Blue. Cannon also directed the pilot episode for Dark Blue.In 2010, Cannon joined The CW action series Nikita, as director and executive producer.In 2011, Cannon executive produced and directed the pilot for the FOX crime/mystery Alcatraz.",

Haller studied at the renowned Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles.In 1953, Haller started as an art director in television, then quickly graduated to low budget feature films. Among many other credits, Haller designed the deceptively opulent sets for nearly all of Roger Corman\u0027s critically acclaimed Edgar Allan Poe film series, including House of Usher (1960) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961).Haller directed his first film, Die, Monster, Die!, in 1965 for American International Pictures. Based on H. P. Lovecraft\u0027s short story The Colour Out of Space, it was very similar in plot and atmosphere to Corman\u0027s Poe films. After directing two motorcycle pictures (The Devil\u0027s Angels (1967) and The Wild Racers (1968)), Haller filmed another Lovecraft adaptation, The Dunwich Horror (1970).From 1972, all of Haller\u0027s subsequent work has been in television, including directing episodes of Night Gallery, Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Today he lives with his family in a horse ranch in the San Fernando Valley.Description above from the Wikipedia article Daniel Haller, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Franz Antel (June 28, 1913 – August 11, 2007) was a veteran Austrian filmmaker.Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies (romantic, slapstick, and/or musical) and K.u.k. films all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst (Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I.From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of Wirtin (\"hostess\") films, directed under the pseudonym François Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan (1967), Sexy Susan Sins Again (1969), Wild, Willing \u0026amp; Sexy (1969) and Don\u0027t Tell Daddy (aka Naughty Nymphs in the U.S.A.) (1972).Among the actors Antel worked with were Hans Moser, Paul Hörbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd Jürgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andréa Ferréol.1981 was a turning point in Antel\u0027s career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war, Der Bockerer is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer (Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed.Der Bockerer IVThe film\u0027s strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the crème de la crème of Austrian actors and actresses (Ida Krottendorf, Alfred Böhm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made Der Bockerer an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel\u0027s career. He made three sequels, which follow the lives of the Bockerers well into the 1960s, each depicting a crucial historical event in Austria or one of its neighbouring countries:    Der Bockerer II (1996) is about the ten-year occupation (1945-1955) of Austria by the allied powers;    Der Bockerer III — Die Brücke von Andau (2000) is set at the time of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; and, finally,    Der Bockerer IV — Der Prager Frühling (2003) deals with Dubček\u0027s Prague Spring of 1968.Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room – especially when he was travelling alone.Description above from the Wikipedia article Franz Antel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Georges Franju was a French filmmaker.He was born in Fougères, Ille-et-Vilaine. Before working in French cinema, Franju had several different jobs. Franju was also briefly in the military in Algeria and was discharged in 1932. On his return, Franju studied to become a set designer and later created backdrops for music halls including Casino de Paris and the Folles Bergère.In the mid-thirties, Franju and Henri Langlois met through Franju\u0027s twin brother Jacques Franju. As well as creating the 16 mm short film Le Métro, Langlois and Franju also started a short-lived film magazine and created a film club called Le Cercle du Cinema with 500 francs he borrowed from Langlois\u0027 parents. The club showed silent films from their own collections followed by an informal debate about them amongst members. From Le Cercle du Cinema, Franju and Langlois founded the Cinématheque Française in 1936.Franju ceased to be closely related with the Cinématheque Française as early as 1938, and only became associated with it strongly again in the 1980s when he was appointed as the honorary artistic director of the Cinématheque.In 1949, Franju began work on a series of nine documentary films. The Nazi occupation of Paris and the industrialism following World War II influenced Franju\u0027s early works.With Head Against the Wall (French:La tête contre les murs) in 1958, Franju turned toward fiction feature films. His second feature was the horror film Eyes Without a Face (French:Les Yeux sans Visage) about a surgeon who tries to repair his daughter\u0027s ruined face by grafting on to it the faces of beautiful women. His 1963 film Judex was a tribute to the silent film serials Judex and Fantomas. In Franju\u0027s later years his film work became less frequent. Franju occasionally directed for television and in the late seventies he retired from filmmaking to preside over the Cinématheque Française.In her study of French cinema since the French new wave, Claire Clouzot described Franju\u0027s film style as \"a poignant fantastic realism inherited from surrealism and Jean Painlevé science cinema, and influenced by the expressionism of Lang and Murnau\". Franju\u0027s focus was on the visual aspect of filmmaking, which he claimed marked a director as an auteur. Franju claimed to \"not have the story writing gift\" and was focused on what he described as the \"putting into form\" of the film.Franju was also extremely influenced by surrealism. He used elements of surrealism and shock horror within his films in order to “awaken” his audience. Franju had a long history of friendship with well-known surrealists including Andre Breton, and the influence of this movement is extremely evident in his works. Franju uses these elements to link horror, history, and an ironic commentary on modernity’s ideal of progress. Franju is quoted as having said “It’s the bad combination, it’s the wrong synthesis, constantly being made by the eye as it looks around, that stops us from seeing everything as strange.”Description above from the Wikipedia article Georges Franju , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His best known film is A Night to Remember which won a Golden Globe for best foreign English language film in 1959. His later career was varied, and included many horror films and television shows.Baker\u0027s early career, from 1934 to 1939, was spent working for Gainsborough Pictures, a British film production company based in Islington, North London, famous for its prestige productions. His first jobs were menial - making tea for crew members, for example - but by 1938 he had risen through the ranks to work as assistant director on Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s The Lady Vanishes.He served in the army during World War II, until transferring to the Army Kinematograph Unit in 1943 in order to make better use of skills developed in his pre-war career producing documentaries and teaching materials for troops. One of his superiors at the time was novelist Eric Ambler. It was he who gave Baker his first big break directing The October Man, from an Ambler screenplay, in 1947. Ambler also adapted Walter Lord\u0027s A Night to Remember for Baker\u0027s 1958 screen version.During the early 1950s, Baker worked for three years in Hollywood where he directed Marilyn Monroe in Don\u0027t Bother to Knock (1952) and Robert Ryan in 3D film noir Inferno (1953). He returned to the UK for the latter part of the decade, but defected to television in the early 1960s.He directed episodes of The Avengers, The Saint and The Champions - all adventure series created with an eye on the American market. The low-budget ethic of television production made him well-suited to his next career move into cheaply produced but lavish-looking British horror films. He directed, amongst others, Quatermass and the Pit (1967) The Vampire Lovers (1970) and Scars of Dracula (1970) for Hammer, and Asylum (1972) for Amicus.In the latter part of the 1970s he returned to television, and throughout the 1980s continued to work in Television.  He retired in 1992.",

In his earlier exhibitions, at the beginning of the sixties, he showed a great interest in conceptual art and the emerging visual technologies. Esteemed as an atypical director in the Spanish cinema, in 1986 he retired to Tarragona in order to devote his time to painting. In 1990 the producer Andrés Vicente Gómez persuaded him to return to cinema and entrusted to him the direction of \u0027Las edades de Lulú\u0027, a film which reached the general public. Without abandoning his dedication to painting and photography, reflected in numerous exhibitions, he began the well-known \u0027Trilogía Ibérica\u0027 with \u0027Jamón Jamón\u0027, \u0027Huevos de Oro\u0027 and \u0027La teta y la luna\u0027. Subsequently, with the short film for internet \u0027Collar de Moscas\u0027 (2001), he revived his interest in avant-garde experimentation and audiovisual formats and at the same time he discovered a vocation for the investigation of digital cinema after the creation of the \u0027Taller Bigas Luna\u0027 project with Catalina Pons in 1999. The experience in the Taller introduced them to the world of new technologies and in 2002 they promoted PLATAFORM BL, dedicated to the creation and promotion of innovative projects and new talents. Despite being catalan, he is a lover of the aragonese culture. He re-designed an old folkloric cabaret café \u0027El Plata\u0027 in Zaragoza.",

        "biography": "Claude Autant-Lara was a French film director and later Member of the European Parliament (MEP).Born at Luzarches in Val-d\u0027Oise, Autant-Lara was educated in France and at London\u0027s Mill Hill School during his mother\u0027s exile as a pacifist. Early in his career, he worked as an art director and costume designer, his best-known work in this vein was possibly for Nana (1926), a silent film directed by Jean Renoir. Autant-Lara also acted in the film.As a director, he frequently created provocative movies, saying \"if a film does not have venom, it is worthless\". In the 1960s, he turned his back on the New Wave movement, and from then on he had no popular successes.On 18 June 1989, he came to public notice again, controversially, when he was elected to the European Parliament as a member of the National Front and the oldest member of the assembly. In his maiden speech, in July 1989, he caused a scandal by expressing his \"concerns about the American cultural threat\", provoking a walkout by the majority of the deputies.In an interview granted to the monthly magazine Globe in September 1989, he accused ex-President of the European Parliament and Holocaust survivor Simone Veil of playing \"ethnic politics\" to try and \"infiltrate and dominate\", saying that \"If they try to speak to me about genocide, I say they missed mother Veil!\" He also described Nazi gas chambers as a \"string of lies\". The resulting scandal led to his resignation as European deputy. Moreover, the members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, of which he was a vice-president for life, voted to prohibit him from taking his seat thenceforth.His memoir, The Rage in the Heart, appeared in 1984. He died at Antibes in Alpes-Maritimes in 2000.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

All his films are made in Australia with predominantly Australian casts. He has made only three films in two decades, yet they have been some of the most critically acclaimed works in Australian cinema during that time. He is famous for his insistence on \"complete creative control\", one-take shoots and use of natural light. He makes commercials in between films.Lawrence\u0027s unique cinematic style has established him as one of the most respected dramatic directors of contemporary Australian cinema. While only producing three films in his 25 year career as a feature film director, all of his features have meditated around the slippery and often painful nature of \u0027real\u0027 human interaction. It is Lawrence\u0027s ability to illustrate intensely personal interactions between characters as they navigate through the less than \u0027cinematic\u0027 terrain of real life situations that has engaged his audience and earned the respect among cinema goers and critics alike.His second feature, Lantana (2001), is one of the highest grossing Australian films ever made winning critical and popular recognition including Best film, Australian Film Institute (AFI) Awards. Examining the notion of trust, the film weaves the mysterious disappearance of a wealthy psychiatrist across the fabric of three Australian families, with each family representative of a different social class existent in contemporary Australian society.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ray Lawrence , licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After the genre\u0027s popularity quickly died out, Sollima was among the first ones to move to spaghetti westerns. The Big Gundown (starring Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian) was released in 1966 with big success, despite the fact that it had to compete with Sergio Leone\u0027s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Sergio Corbucci\u0027s Django. Sollima soon filmed two more westerns. Face to Face (Milian and Gian Maria Volonté) was released in 1967 and Run, Man, Run! (Milian) in 1968. Although Sollima directed only three westerns and they never reached the level of popularity as the ones by the other Sergios (Leone and Corbucci), each of them are highly regarded among genre enthusiasts.In 1970, Sollima switched genres again and directed the Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas starred Violent City, which was one of the first violent and fast-paced Italian crime films often known as poliziotteschi. Like for all of his westerns, the soundtrack was provided by Ennio Morricone. Sollima\u0027s last well-known film is Revolver, a poliziotteschi film starring Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi.Description above from the Wikipedia article Sergio Sollima, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Despite a fairly varied early career, Thomas is now almost exclusively remembered as the director of 30 Carry On films, the innuendo-laden and financially hugely-successful British comedy series, produced by Peter Rogers, beginning with Carry On Sergeant in 1958.Description above from the Wikipedia article Gerald Thomas licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Il fait partie du trio Les Inconnus.Il passe son enfance à Tours où son père est professeur d\u0027italien. Son baccalauréat en poche, il part pour Paris suivre des cours de théâtre et s\u0027inscrit au Cours Simon. Si ses parents l\u0027aident un peu financièrement, il est persuadé que, pour être un bon acteur, il faut d\u0027abord « galérer ». Il connaît alors, en effet, des années difficiles avant d\u0027intégrer, en 1981, le Petit Théâtre de Bouvard, où il rencontre ses amis Didier Bourdon et Pascal Légitimus. S\u0027il a l\u0027esprit de « groupe », les jeux de pouvoir qui naissent au sein du Petit Théâtre ne l\u0027intéressent pas. Il part donc avec ses deux acolytes en 1982. Sept ans plus tard, ils créent le trio comique Les Inconnus, avec le producteur Paul Lederman. Ils rencontrent un succès populaire phénoménal, avec notamment la Télé des Inconnus et de nombreux sketches devenus cultes (notamment Télé magouille, Tournez ménages, les Chasseurs, Biouman, le Commissariat de police, Perdu de recherche, Les sectes (avec Skippy le Grand Gourou) ou encore Auteuil Neuilly Passy). Les années 2000 sont un tournant dans sa carrière, peut-être dû à sa rencontre et au début de son amitié avec le philosophe Alexandre Jollien. On le découvre dans des rôles plus dramatiques comme dans Se souvenir des belles choses de Zabou Breitman, Combien tu m\u0027aimes? de Bertrand Blier et Le dernier pour la route de Philippe Godeau. En 2010, il rejoint le collectif des cinéastes pour les sans-papiers en soutien aux travailleurs immigrés en attente d\u0027un titre de séjour.  ",

He followed it with the 1979 La Terre au ventre, a story of the Algerian War of Independence.Since the 1981 Corre, gitano, Gatlif\u0027s work has been focused on the Romani people of Europe, from whom he partially traces his descent.After making Gaspard et Robinson in 1990, Gatlif spent 1992 and 1993 shooting Latcho Drom,which was awarded numerous prizes. This feature-length musical film,often mislabelled as a documentary, deals with gypsy culture throughoutthe world around the theme of their music and dance. For Vincent Ostria,then journalist at the Cahiers du Cinéma, it was \"the most genuine filmof the year (1993 editor\u0027s note).\" A year later, Gatlif brought theworld of the author J. M. G. Le Clézio (pen-name) to the screen in Mondo (1994).His 2004 film Exils, won the Best Director Award at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.  His film Transylvania also premiered at Cannes in May 2006.",

His films are known for incorporating sexuality, and are often categorized as erotica.He was born Zalman Lefkovitz in Trenton, New Jersey, U.S. As a young man in 1963 he played a gang member on Alfred Hitchcock Presents (\"Memo from Purgatory\" written by Harlan Ellison) with James Caan and Walter Koenig. In 1967 he played the outlaw Muley in \"Muley\", an episode of the TV show Gunsmoke. His character shoots Marshall Matt Dillon as part of a plan to rob the Dodge City Bank, but as he and his gang are waiting for Dillon to recover (so they can try again to kill him), Muley falls in love with one of the girls at the Long Branch Saloon, which thwarts the plan.From September 1970 until May 1971, King played attorney Aaron Silverman on the drama The Young Lawyers, broadcast on the ABC television network. King later contributed a unique delivery to Trip with the Teacher (1975), portraying the psychopathic Al, a narcoleptic murdering motorbiker.King has directed several commercially successful films, including Two Moon Junction (1988), Wild Orchid (1990), and Red Shoe Diaries (1992), which became a long-running television series for Showtime network. It spawned many sequels. He is perhaps best known for his collaboration with director Adrian Lyne on the film 9½ Weeks which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. He produced (and usually directed) the television series and film ChromiumBlue.com and Showtime series Body Language. He appeared in Lee Grant\u0027s directorial debut feature film Tell Me a Riddle.Other work as director includes the 1995 film Delta of Venus based on the book by Anaïs Nin and starring Audie England. The film about an American girl living in Paris in 1939 is in many ways reminiscent of European art house films where erotica forms a centerpiece to a plot which is nevertheless about greater issues.He is married to writer/producer Patricia Louisianna Knop. They have collaborated on many projects, such as writing Wild Orchid, Delta of Venus and 9½ Weeks as well as many episodes of Red Shoe Diaries. They have two daughters, Chloe King and Gillian Lefkowitz.Description above from the Wikipedia article Zalman King, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His photographs were used to illustrate Charles Gaines\u0027 1974 essay \"Pumping Iron\", on which Butler later based his first documentary feature, Pumping Iron (1977). The film showcased Schwarzenegger and other bodybuilders that is credited with starting Schwarzenegger\u0027s film career. Butler later directed a sequel, also based on Gaines\u0027 writing, called Pumping Iron II: The Women (1985). It featured Bev Francis, Rachel McLish, and several other women.Butler initially worked sparingly as a documentary filmmaker making 3 films between 1977 and 1999. However, in recent years he has started to work more regularly. In 2000, he made The Endurance a 97 minute documentary about Ernest Shackleton\u0027s failed Antarctic expedition in 1914. The film was well received by critics, and was nominated for and won several awards.The following year, Butler released a documentary, Shackleton\u0027s Antarctic Adventure, which recounts the crew\u0027s heroism. Narrated by Kevin Spacey, the film is 57 minutes shorter than The Endurance.In 2004, Butler again collaborated with John Kerry this time to make the documentary Going Upriver. Going Upriver is about Kerry\u0027s Vietnam experiences, his activity in the peace movement following his return from Vietnam, and his current political views and theories. It includes footage from the early 1970s of Kerry along with current interviews of Kerry and a host of other veterans.Butler\u0027s most recent documentary is Roving Mars (2006), a 40 min. documentary about the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which were launched by NASA in 2004.On December 31, 2008, Butler\u0027s close friend Charlie Rose included a segment on Butler in his annual New Year\u0027s Eve tribute to recently deceased notables on PBS.

Dawson, was a prolific Italian filmmaker. He was born in Rome and died in 2002 from a heart attack in Monterosi, Viterbo, near Rome at the age of 72.Margheriti started out in the Italian film industry in 1956 as a screenwriter. He started directing in 1960, his first film being \"Spacemen\" (aka \"Assignment Outer Space\"). Margheriti is known for his science fiction, horror, spaghetti western and action movies. He was the director of such cult movies as Cannibal Apocalypse, Castle of Blood, The Virgin of Nuremberg, Assignment Outer Space, Wild Wild Planet, Naked You Die, Mr. Super Invisible, The Last Hunter, Battle of the Worlds and numerous others. Most of his films were directed under the pseudonym of Anthony M. Dawson. He stopped using his real name in the USA early in his career, when he realized the English translation of the name \"Antonio Margheriti\" was \"Anthony Daisies\", and he thought it sounded too effeminate.He was the only Italian director who worked directly for American production companies like MGM, United Artists, 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, etc. with films like: Yor, the Hunter from the Future, Take a Hard Ride, Killer Fish, etc. Margheriti said his action/adventure films were his favorites, and his least favorite movies were the sword-and-sandal peplum films he made in the early 1960s (such as \"Devil of the Desert\" and \"Giants of Rome\").For years, director Richard Morrissey disputed Margheriti\u0027s claim that he had directed \"Andy Warhol\u0027s Frankenstein\" in the early 1970s, saying that Margheriti was mostly just a technical advisor on that film. Morrissey said Margheriti did however direct a very, very brief segment of the movie (mostly the scenes involving the two children roaming around in the lab).Margheriti worked with many well-known genre actors such as Lee Van Cleef, John Saxon, Claude Rains, John Morghen, Klaus Kinski, Barbara Steele, Reb Brown, Donald Pleasence, Yul Brynner, David Warbeck, Luciano Pigozzi, Marvin Hagler, Terence Hill, Fred Williamson, Christopher Lee and many others. Most of his later films were shot in the Philippines (especially his war films). Margheriti also collaborated on the special effects in two Italian cult films which he did not direct, Sergio Leone\u0027s \"Fistful of Dynamite\" (1971) and Aldo Lado\u0027s \"The Humanoid\" (1979).Margheriti retired from filmmaking in 1996 at age 66. He died in 2002 of natural causes. Margheriti\u0027s son Edoardo and his daughter Antonella are both also involved in filmmaking. Eli Roth\u0027s character in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Bastards took Margheriti as his namesake.Description above from the Wikipedia article Antonio Margheriti,  licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Róbert Douglas followed the success of his first film with a darker film about subtle racism in Iceland\u0027s society, A Man Like Me (2002). That film proved to be another commercial success in Iceland. Douglas then made Eleven Men Out (2005), a film about an all-gay soccer team. The film has already become a success outside of Iceland and is the director\u0027s first film to do so. Before making Eleven Men Out, Douglas made a documentary for television. This Is Sanlitun (2013), a comedy feature film set in Beijing is Douglas\u0027s latest film and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013, it is Douglas\u0027s first English language film.",

Boskovich was raised in the San Fernando Valley, an only child. John attended Notre Dame High School. Boskovich graduated from USC, and then earned an MFA at California Institute of the Arts, where he was a student of John Baldessari, a conceptual artist who became a mentor. While attending CalArts, Boskovich simultaneously earned a law degree at Loyola Law School, although he never practiced law. In the late 1980s Boskovich co-wrote and directed Without You I\u0027m Nothing, a one-woman off-Broadway show starring actress and comedienne Sandra Bernhard. He also directed the subsequent 1990 film version. He later went on to direct North, a 2001 film which featured artist and writer Gary Indiana reading from Louis-Ferdinand Céline\u0027s novel of the same name. As an artist, Boskovich was indebted to the Dadaists, and used found objects, photography, handwritten and typeset texts, as well as audio sources to create witty, sharp-edged, social commentary. From 1988 to 1999, Boskovich exhibited at the Rosamund Felsen Gallery, now in Bergamot Station in Santa Monica, CA. A 1994 show entitled \"Rude Awakening\" was inspired by his friendship and work with the band Rude Awakening, which included one of his friends, bassist Robert Calkin (a.k.a. Robert Ryder). The band\u0027s logo was included in many of his works. He also did the photography for their Headbutter E.P. using a technique he originated that incorporated video, television and polaroid cameras. In the mid-1990s, Boskovich taught at Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles. He curated several shows of his students\u0027 works at Rosamund Felsen. Boskovich died at his home on September 24, 2006, aged 49, from undisclosed causesDescription above from the Wikipedia article  John Boskovich, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In the 1950s, Wood made a number of cheap genre films, now enjoyed for their technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.Wood\u0027s popularity waned soon after his biggest \"name\" star, Béla Lugosi, died. He was able to salvage a saleable feature from Lugosi\u0027s last moments on film, but his career declined thereafter. Toward the end of his life, Wood made pornographic movies and wrote pulp crime, horror, and sex novels. His infamy began two years after his death, when he was awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time.[1] The lack of filmmaking ability in his work has earned Wood and his films a considerable cult following.Following the publication of Rudolph Grey\u0027s biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1992), Wood\u0027s life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts, with new light shed on his evident zeal and honest love of movies and movie production. Tim Burton\u0027s biopic of the director\u0027s life, Ed Wood, earned two Academy Awards.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ed Wood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He has spent much of his professional life working on advertisement spots, directing over 400 commercials and two short films, but only directing four feature-length films in three decades.",

His first screen test was a love scene with Karen Black which led him to become an actor under contract with MGM Studios, where he co-starred in Ice Station Zebra (1968) with Rock Hudson as well as various Aaron Spelling productions. After years of acting, Lee found a passion for working behind the camera and, in 1971, directed his first feature film, On the Line (1971). His son, Shane Stanley, was the youngest to ever receive an Emmy Award when he was 16 years old for his work on Desperate Passage (1987), which Lee directed and won two Emmys for. That special launched The Desperate Passage Series, which was nominated for thirty-three Emmys and won thirteen over a six year period. Daughter Quinn Gonzalez, from Lee\u0027s first marriage, is the granddaughter of legendary songwriter Johnny Burke of the Burke \u0026amp; Van Heusen team, (Misty, Pennies From Heaven, Swingin\u0027 on a Star). His film Street Pirates (1994) won him a CINE Golden Eagle Award for Best Documentary. Lee received The Christopher Award as well as many other top humanitarian honors for his work with America\u0027s probated youth, which were the theme for many of his TV specials. Lee wrote and directed Held for Ransom (2000) starring Dennis Hopper based on the novel by Lois Duncan I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) as well as co-writing and directing Carman: The Champion (2001) which starred Michael Nouri Patricia Manterola and long time friend Jed Allan.",

He won the Grand Prix du Festival at the Cannes Film Festival twice: in 1946 for Iris and the Lieutenant (Swedish: Iris och löjtnantshjärta) (part of an eleven-way tie), and in 1951 for his film Miss Julie (Swedish: Fröken Julie)[1] (an adaption of the August Strindberg\u0027s play which tied with Vittorio De Sica\u0027s Miracle in Milan).Despite his success with films Torment (1944) and Miss Julie, Sjöberg was above all, and foremost, a stage director; perhaps the greatest at Dramaten (alongside, first, Olof Molander and, later, Ingmar Bergman). He was a First Director of Sweden\u0027s Royal Dramatic Theatre in the years 1930-1980, where he staged a large number of remarkable and historic productions. Sjöberg was also a pioneer director for early Swedish TV theatre (his 1955 TV theatre production of Hamlet is a national milestone).Sjöberg died in a car accident on his way to rehearsal at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alf Sjöberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAnne Fontaine (born in Luxembourg, 1959) is a filmmaker and screenwriter who used to be an actor. She lives and works in France.Born Fontaine Sibertin-Blanc, sister of actor Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc, she went as a young child to live in Lisbon, where her father, Antoine Sibertin-Blanc, is a music professor and cathedral organist. In adolescence she moved to Paris and trained in dance with Joseph Russillo while continuing her academic education, including philosophy. Her husband is Philippe Carcassonne, the film producer, and they have an adopted son who was born in Vietnam.While still dancing, she was picked by Robert Hossein to play Esmeralda in a 1980 theatrical production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and around this time started to use the name Anne Fontaine. She continued with acting and became known for her roles in comedies like Si ma gueule vous plaît... (1981) and P.R.O.F.S.(1985). An opportunity to be assistant director came with a 1986 stage version of Céline\u0027s Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) at the Renaud-Barrault theatre.Fontaine\u0027s first project as solo director, Les histoires d\u0027amour finissent mal... en général (Love Affairs Usually End Badly), won the 1993 Prix Jean Vigo (prize). In 1995, she worked with her brother on the comic Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and directed the successful Nettoyage à Sec (Dry Cleaning). This won the Best Screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival 1997 and is generally considered a milestone on Fontaine\u0027s way to becoming \"an important figure in contemporary French cinema\".In 1999 the character Augustin (Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc) re-appeared in Fontaine\u0027s film Augustin, Roi Du Kung-Fu (Augustin, King of Kung-Fu). Comment j\u0027ai tué mon père (How I Killed My Father) was released in 2001, and Nathalie... followed in 2003. The 2005 film, Entre Ses Mains (In His Hands) has been widely described as a thriller: an \"intimate thriller\" according to Fontaine herself. A third Augustin film, Nouvelle chance (also known as Oh La La) was released in 2006. Then came La fille de Monaco (The Girl From Monaco) in 2008 and Coco avant Chanel (Coco Before Chanel), her biopic of Coco Chanel, in 2009.Fontaine\u0027s work is not easily categorised, though the phrase \"psychological drama\" is often used. She told a UK newspaper, \"I try to work on my characters\u0027 blind side, in a kind of Freudian way: to ask, \u0027What are the things about themselves that they\u0027re unaware of?\u0027 I\u0027m fascinated by the irony of fate, when something goes into a skid. All my stories have an element of cruelty in them.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Anne Fontaine (filmmaker), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was frequently credited as E. A. Dupont.A newspaper columnist in 1916, Dupont became a screenwriter and began directing his own crime-story scripts in 1918. After several successes in his native Germany in silent films, he worked in London and in Hollywood, California. One of his greatest successes was the silent film Varieté (1925). This film, about an ex-trapeze artist, was noted for its innovative camerawork with highly expressive movement through space, accomplished by the prolific expressionist cinematographer Karl Freund. Varieté even did well in the United States, screening for 12 weeks at New York\u0027s Rialto Theatre. Dupont\u0027s success was noticed by Carl Laemmle at Universal, who offered Dupont a lucrative contract. His first project was Love Me and the World Is Mine in the early summer of 1926, which ran well over budget ($350,000) and was not a success.His film Piccadilly (1929), a late silent, is noted for the central performance of the Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong. Atlantic (also 1929) is seen as one of the most innovative uses of sound film technology available at the time.After his successes in the UK, Dupont returned to Hollywood in 1933, though he directed only a handful of films after 1939.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ewald André Dupont, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He received an Academy Award for Film Editing for the 1947 film, Body and Soul.Parrish was the son of factory cashier Gordon R. Parrish and Laura R. Parrish. In the mid-1920s, the family moved from Georgia to Los Angeles and Parrish and his sisters Beverly and Helen began obtaining work as actors soon thereafter. Parrish made his film debut in the 1927 Our Gang short Olympic Games. (Their mother, Laura R. Parrish, was an actress as well and appeared in a few films of the 1940s.) He appeared in the anti-war classic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and Charles Chaplin\u0027s City Lights (1931), and in several films for John Ford.Ford then enlisted him as an assistant editor in 1936 on Mary of Scotland, and as a sound editor on Young Mr Lincoln (1939). Parrish worked as an assistant editor and sound editor on other Ford movies as Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Parrish and Ford were in the United States Navy during the Second World War, and worked on documentary and training films including The Battle of Midway (1942).In 1947 he won an Oscar for his debut as a feature film editor on Robert Rossen\u0027s high tempo boxing drama Body and Soul; the award was shared with Francis Lyon. Parrish was later nominated for another Rossen film – the political drama All the King’s Men (1949); he shared the nomination with Al Clark.Parrish went on to contribute his technical talents to a host of highly regarded films and made a promising directorial debut in 1951 with the gripping revenge melodrama, Cry Danger. His subsequent output met with varying success. The Purple Plain (1954) was nominated for \"Best British film\" at the 8th British Academy Film Awards. One of the most notorious of his films was the James Bond Parody Casino Royale (1967), in which he was one of the film\u0027s five directors. His last film, on which he shared co-director credit with Bertrand Tavernier, was Mississippi Blues (1983).Parrish wrote two memoirs, Growing Up in Hollywood (1976) and its sequel Hollywood Doesn\u0027t Live Here Anymore (1988). Of the first, Kevin Brownlow wrote, \"His stories about these pictures were marvellous in themselves, and he often came at them sideways, so not only the punchline but the situation took you by surprise. We all entreated him to write them down and in 1976 he did so, producing one of the most enchanting - and hilarious - books about the picture business ever written. It was called Growing Up in Hollywood and it ought to be reprinted in this centenary year.\" Summing up Parrish\u0027s career, Allen Grant Richards wrote, \"Other than his excellent editing work and early directing, Parrish may be most remembered as storyteller from his two books of Hollywood memoirs.\"",

Show, One Potato, Two Potato (1964), The Other Side of the Mountain (1975), and Oscar nominee Two-Minute Warning (1976).The son of operatic tenor Jan Peerce and talent agent Alice (Kalmanowitz) Peerce, Larry Peerce was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York. He attended the University of North Carolina. He made his directing debut with One Potato, Two Potato, released in 1964 by the distributor Cinema V. The groundbreaking drama about an interracial marriage between a white divorcee (played by Barbara Barrie, who won the Best Actress award at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival for the role) and an African-American office worker (Bernie Hamilton) was the first U.S. movie to portray such an interracial relationship.Peerce went on to direct several episodes of the Western television series Branded and the campy superhero series Batman, among other shows, before directing the early rock and roll concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, released in 1966 by American International Pictures and featuring such performers as The Byrds, Ray Charles, Bo Diddley, Donovan, The Lovin\u0027 Spoonful, The Ronettes and The Ike \u0026 Tina Turner Revue.Following more TV, Peerce returned to film in 1967 with The Mystery of the Chinese Junk and The Incident, the latter of which starred Martin Sheen and Tony Musante. He followed this with the acclaimed Goodbye, Columbus, an adaptation of the Philip Roth novel. The movie earned Peerce a DGA Award nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures, and screenwriter Arnold Schulman an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.Peerce\u0027s subsequent theatrical features included The Sporting Club, A Separate Peace, Ash Wednesday, and The Other Side of the Mountain. Peerce\u0027s work is frequently viewed as part of the expressive sentimental directorial style with a particular focus on coming-of-age stories.",

He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark.Melchior\u0027s novels include Code Name: Grand Guignol, Eva, The Haigerloch Project, The Marcus Device, Order of Battle: Hitler\u0027s Werewolves, Sleeper Agent, The Tombstone Cipher and The Watchdogs of Abaddon.His non-fiction includes the books Quest: Searching for Germany\u0027s Nazi Past (with co-author Frank Brandenburg) and Lauritz Melchior: The Golden Years of Bayreuth, the latter a biography of his father, the opera singer and movie star Lauritz Melchior. With his wife, L.A. architect Cleo Baldon, Ib Melchior wrote the non-fiction books Reflections on the Pool: California Designs for Swimming and Steps \u0026amp; Stairways.Melchior also wrote Hour of Vengeance, a play based on the Viking story of Amled that also inspired William Shakespeare\u0027s play Hamlet. In 1982, it was awarded the Hamlet Award for best playwriting by the Shakespeare Society of America.As a filmmaker, Melchior wrote and directed The Angry Red Planet (1959) and The Time Travelers (1964). His most high profile credit was as co-screenwriter (along with John C. Higgins) of Byron Haskin\u0027s critically acclaimed Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). He cowrote the screenplays for two U.S.-Danish coproductions, Reptilicus (1961) and Journey to the Seventh Planet (1962), and provided the English language script for Mario Bava\u0027s Planet of the Vampires (1965).For television, he wrote \"The Premonition\" episode for the second season of the original The Outer Limits series. The episode was broadcast in 1965.Melchior\u0027s short story The Racer was adapted as Paul Bartel\u0027s cult film favorite, Death Race 2000 (1975), starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone and produced by Roger Corman. It was later remade as Death Race (2008), starring Jason Statham and Joan Allen, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and produced by Tom Cruise.He claims to be the creator of the original idea upon which Irwin Allen based his television series Lost in Space, although he never received onscreen credit for this. In 1960, Melchior had created an outline for a series he called \"Space Family Robinson\", which later became a Gold Key comic book. Ed Shifres\u0027 book Lost in Space: The True Story is a detailed documentation of how Irwin Allen allegedly plagiarized Melchior\u0027s script, with the two outlines presented side by side.Decades later, Prelude Pictures hired Melchior as a consultant on its Lost in Space feature film adaptation, but later sold his contract to New Line Cinema, its production partner on the film. New Line agreed to pay Melchior a $75,000 production bonus and $15,000, but refused him his contractually promised two percent of the producer\u0027s gross receipts from the film.Melchior, who is a decorated war hero of World War II, has also been involved in a long legal battle involving his father\u0027s estate, Chossewitz in Brandenburg, Germany, which was confiscated by the communist government of East Germany and never returned.In 1965, he was dubbed Knight Commander of the Militant Order of Saint Brigitte of Sweden.In 1976, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films awarded Ib Melchior its Golden Scroll Award to Merit for Outstanding Achievement.Biographies include Ib Melchior: Man of Imagination by Robert Skotak, as well as Melchior\u0027s own autobiography Case by Case: A U.S. Army Counterintelligence Agent in World War II.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ib Melchior, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Andrew McLaglen was born in London, the son of British actor Victor McLaglen and Enid Lamont. He was from a film family that included eight uncles and an aunt, and he grew up on movie sets with his parents as well as John Wayne and John Ford. After working as an assistant director on a few smaller films, Ford gave him the assistant director job on the film The Quiet Man (1952). After a few more assistant or second director jobs, McLaglen directed his first film Gun The Man Down in 1956 - a western B-movie with James Arness, Angie Dickinson and Harry Carey, Jr.. He went on to work extensively in television directing, directing episodes of Perry Mason (7), Gunslinger (5), Rawhide (6), and then 99 episodes of Have Gun – Will Travel, The Lieutenant (4), The Virginian (2), and 96 episodes of Gunsmoke. Returning to films - directing Shenandoah (1965) and The Rare Breed (1966), both with James Stewart; The Devil\u0027s Brigade (1968), Mitchell (1975), The Wild Geese (1978), North Sea Hijack (1979), and The Sea Wolves (1980), mostly westerns, but later specializing in war or action films, his last being Return from the River Kwai (1989). He also worked many times with John Wayne in such films as McLintock! (1963), Hellfighters (1968), The Undefeated (1969), Chisum (1970), and Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973). He also directed The Last Hard Men (1976) which starred Charlton Heston and James Coburn. McLaglen directed films in an assortment of categories, including crime, war, historical and comedy, but he was most frequently a director of Westerns, and would be among the last of the American film directors to specialize in the Western genre. He currently resides in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, Washington State, directing plays for San Juan Island Community Theater.Description above from the Wikipedia article Andrew McLaglen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Birth Name: James Wnoroski.A 25-year veteran in the Hollywood exploitation field, writer/producer/director Jim Wynorski is responsible for over 150 varied motion pictures in a myriad of genres. Leaving behind a successful commercial business in New York, Wynorski relocated to California in 1980 and soon found himself on the doorstep of his childhood idol, B-film king Roger Corman. \"The rest was destiny,\" recounts Wynorski, who soon found himself hired by the renowned movie mogul to cut \"coming attractions\" for all of the company\u0027s new action and horror films. \"It was like grasshopper learning from the kung-fu master,\" says Wynorski, who claims his six-months internship with Corman taught him more than four years at film school.\"It wasn\u0027t long after that Corman offered me the first of many writing/directing assignments. Some distributor wanted a flick about a killer in a shopping mall,\" recalls Wynorski, \"and Roger trusted me enough to say \u0027come up with something good, and you can direct it.\" Well, a couple days later, the director walked in with the first treatment to a film called Chopping Mall (1986), and the rest was history. From then on, Jim Wynorski turned out an average of three to five films a year as a director, and even more as a producer/writer. Throughout the 1980s came a steady stream of wild exploitation titles like Big Bad Mama II (1987) with Angie Dickinson, Not of This Earth (1988) with Traci Lords and The Return of Swamp Thing (1989) with Heather Locklear. On into the 1990s, Wynorski continued to climb to the top of the B-Film mountain with flicks like Hard Bounty (1995) starring Kelly LeBrock, Point of Seduction III: Body Chemistry (1994) \u0026amp; Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure (1995) with Shannon Tweed and Morgan Fairchild and Munchie (1992), which featured the first film appearance of the then-unknown 12-year-old child actress Jennifer Love Hewitt.As the years peeled by and tastes changed, Jim Wynorski kept hip by innovating new special effects techniques that landed the director no less than seven world premieres on the Sci-Fi Channel. His credits there include films like Gargoyle (2004), The Curse of the Komodo (2004), Project Viper and Cry of the Winged Serpent (2007).As for the future, the 59-year-old Wynorski feels the audience for alternative cinema made away from the studio system will continue to grow thanks to new advances in Internet and Cable technologies. In fact, he is in post-production on another thriller, Vampire in Vegas (2009). \"And you can bet I\u0027ll be there,\" he offers with a big smile, \"with some really fun stuff.\" Jim has a huge following in the Mid-West and is beloved in Franklin, Indiana, Home of The B Movie Celebration.

He was also one of the filmmakers interviewed for the Kirby Dick documentary This Film is Not Yet Rated, in which he discusses the apparent absurdity of the fact The Cooler was given an NC-17 certificate by the MPAA simply due to a few seconds long shot of its lead actress\u0027 pubic hair.In 2007, Kramer directed Crossing Over, a Traffic-like ensemble drama about immigration in Los Angeles that incorporated the storyline from Kramer\u0027s 1995 short film of the same name.Kramer\u0027s first feature The Cooler was selected for competition in the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. Kramer was nominated for a 2004 Golden Satellite Award and a 2004 Edgar Allan Poe Award (along with Frank Hannah) for his screenplay to The Cooler, which also received a 2003 Special Mention For Excellence in Filmmaking from the National Board of Review.Description above from the Wikipedia article Wayne Kramer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Starting his career as a child actor in his uncle Nasir Hussain\u0027s film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973), Khan began his professional career eleven years later with Holi (1984) and had his first commercial success with Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988).

After seven previous nominations during the 1980s and 1990s, Khan received his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in the major grosser Raja Hindustani (1996)  and later earned his second Best Actor award for his performance in the Academy Award-nominated Lagaan, which also marked the debut of his own production company.Following a four-year break from acting, Khan made his comeback playing the title role in the historical Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005), and later won a Critics Award for Best Performance for his role in Rang De Basanti (2006). The following year, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, for which he received a Filmfare Award for Best Director.

He has worked on such shows as The Outer Limits, Stargate SG-1 (including its two-hour pilot), and Stargate Atlantis. In 2008 he directed all eight episodes of the highly acclaimed and award winning HBO Canada/TMN miniseries ZOS: Zone of Separation, which he co created and produced. Mario Philip Azzopardi should not be confused with Maltese poet, short story writer and columnist Mario Azzopardi (born 1944), who is also involved in theatre and directs the Malta Drama Centre. In 1971, while still a student at the Royal University of Malta, he directed Gaġġa, presumed to be the first full-length feature filmed entirely in Maltese. Transferred to digital format and enhanced, the film was re-released in Malta in March 2007. Azzopardi left his native Malta for Canada in 1978, following a dispute with local censors and theatre authorities who, in 1977, had cancelled his play, Sulari Fuq Strada Stretta, on the grounds that it was too offensive; the play was eventually presented at the Manoel Theatre in January 2008. Azzopardi was educated at St Aloysius\u0027 College (Birkirkara, Malta), and the Royal University of Malta. Azzopardi is married to Therese and has three children, Lara Azzopardi, Kyra Azzopardi and Yari Azzopardi.Description above from the Wikipedia article Mario Azzopardi,  licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "A true successor to Georges Méliès and a wizard of the big screen, as he was often called, Karel Zeman was born in Ostroměř near Nová Paka in northern Bohemia. A brilliant pioneer of special effects in film, he is still one of the few Czech directors to be universally recognized in the world of cinema.Ever since his childhood he had adored puppets and performed with them in a puppet theater. Despite his artistic talent his parents insisted he study business at high school in Kolín. At the age of 17, responding to advertisement in a newspaper, he went to Aix-en-Provence in the south of France, where he studied advertising design. While in France, he frequently visited the cinema, and became especially interested in animated movies. He was to put this knowledge to good use in his own first attempt at animation – an advertisement for soap.He traveled widely in his youth, hiking in Morocco, Egypt, Yugoslavia and Greece. After his military service he returned to work in advertising, and, in 1939, he was about to make an extended trip to Casablanca in Morocco, as a representative of the Báťa shoe company, but failed to get the necessary papers from the then Protectorate authorities in time and in the end he had to stay put.He then began working as head of the advertising section of a department store in Brno. In 1943, the film director Elmar Klos was sent to make a report about a window-dressing competition which Zeman had recently won. Klos was so taken by Zeman\u0027s work that he immediately offered him a job at the Bata Film Studios, in the Kudlov suburb of Zlín. Thus began the professional career of this later world famous film director and production designer.Zeman often had to struggle against difficult conditions in the technically ill-equipped Kudlov Studios. Many of the workers with whom he started had no particular experience of filming. They, like Zeman himself, had to learn everything on the job. Gradually a coordinated creative team emerged.Journey to the Beginning of Time released in 1955 became Zeman\u0027s breakthrough film, his first to combine live action, animation and puppetry. Four years later, Invention for Destruction saw him shoot to world-wide success. The film was immediately sold to 72 countries and became the most successful Czech film of all time.Zeman continued to develop his highly successful use of special effects in The Fabulous Baron Munchausen and the two Jules Verne adaptations that followed. In the 1970\u0027s, partly motivated by his love for children and the desire to create films specially for them - but also in part because of the difficulty of shooting live action movies - Zeman returned to making strictly animated films.Among Zeman\u0027s close associates were the composer Zdeněk Liška, animator Arnošt Kupčík, production manager Karel Hutěčka and his daughter Ludmila, co-creator of his films from The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor onwards.In the late 70\u0027s Zeman was threatened with the loss of his sight, but he overcame the disease and continued working. In the final stages of his life he suffered from heart problems. Karel Zeman died in Zlín on April 5, 1989.",

Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\" for his work which \"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation.\" His most notable works include El Topo (1970), The Holy Mountain (1973) and Santa Sangre (1989), all of which have had limited release but achieved popularity amongst various countercultural groups. He has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence, and has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson and David Lynch. After a failed attempt to return to filmmaking with a film entitled King Shot starring Marilyn Manson and produced by David Lynch, Alejandro is set to return to cinema with the sequel to El Topo entitled Abel Cain sometime in late 2011 or 2012.Jodorowsky is also a playwright and play director, having produced over one hundred plays, primarily in Mexico where he lived for much of his life. Alongside this he is also a writer, particularly of comic books - his The Incal even has been noted as having a claim to be \"the best comic book\" ever written - as well as books on his own theories about spirituality. Jodorowsky has been involved in the occult and various spiritual and religious groups, including Zen Buddhism and forms of Mexican shamanism, and has formulated his own spiritual system, which he has called \"psychomagic\" and \"psychoshamanism\".Description above from the Wikipedia article Alejandro Jodorowsky, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

There, he won the Princess Grace Award, the Dore Schary Award presented by the Anti-Defamation League, the Jack Nicholson directing award, and was recognized as an honoree for the IFP/West program Project: Involve.After making his student short, \"When the Kids Are Away\", Chu was signed to William Morris Agency and attached to several high profile projects.

Sony recently got back into business with Chu to direct their updated version of The Great Gatsby. He also is in a dance crew called AC/DC or Adam/Chu Dance crew.

He also attended Pinewood School from kindergarten through 12th grade. Chu is currently directing the online series The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.In an interview, Chu addressed a question he is often asked, \"Why do all of your films have dance?\" He responded, \"I don’t know why. It seems so obvious. But there’s something about the dancers that motivate me the most. I don’t know if it’s just dance, but I do think that the dancers are amazing artists, and every time I meet a new dancer, that triggers something in my brain, and I’m more creative than I could ever be.

        "biography": "​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Asif Kapadia (born 1972) is a British filmmaker of Indian descent. He directed several award-winning films, including The Sheep Thief (1997), winner of the 2nd Prize Cinéfondation for Short Film at the Cannes Film Festival, The Warrior (2001), which won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film and Senna (2010), winner of the World Cinema Audience Award Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2011.BAFTA award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia is known for his visually striking films which explore the lives of ‘outsiders’, characters living in timeless, extreme and unforgiving circumstances or landscapes. His films have been awarded and distributed internationally and shown how versatile and expressive British cinema can be.Born in Hackney, London in 1972, Kapadia studied filmmaking at the Royal College of Art where he first gained recognition with his short The Sheep Thief (1997) telling the story of a gifted street kid and the family who take him in, made with non professional actors in Rajasthan, India, the film won many awards including Second Prize at the 1998 Cannes International Film Festival Cinefondation, the Grand Prix at the 1997 European Short Film Festival in Brest \u0026amp; Best Director at the Recontres Henri Langlois Festival International des Ecoles de Cinema in Poitiers 1997.Kapadia’s distinct visual style continued with his first feature The Warrior (2001, FilmFour), shot in the deserts of Rajasthan and the snow capped Himalaya. The Warrior was championed in the British Press as ‘epic’and ‘stunning’ (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian) and was nominated for three BAFTA awards, winning two the Alexander Korda Award for the outstanding British Film of the Year 2002 and The Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a Director, Screenwriter or Producer in their First Feature.The Warrior also won the Grand Prix at the Dinard Film Festival, the prestigious Sutherland Award at the London Film Festival, the Evening Standard British Film Awards for the Most Promising Newcomer, the Douglas Hickox Award for Best Debut Film and the Technical Achievement Award for Cinematography at the British Independent Film Awards and the Jury Prize for the best cinematography at the San Sebastian Film Festival.Far North (2007, FILM4), premiered at the Venice Film Festival, based on a dark short story by Sara Maitland. Kapadia used the epic and brutal arctic landscape to show how desperation and loneliness drive a woman to harm the person she loves the most.Kapadia\u0027s fourth feature Senna, (2010, Working Title / Universal Pictures) the epic story of the monumental life and tragic death of legendary Brazilian motor-racing Champion, Ayrton Senna. Spanning the decade from his arrival in Formula One in the mid 80’s, the film follows Senna’s struggles both on track against his nemesis, French World Champion Alain Prost, and off it, against the politics which infest the sport. Sublime, spiritual and, on occasion, ruthless – Ayrton Senna conquers and transcends Formula One to become a global superstar. Privately, he is humble and fiercely patriotic, donating millions to his native Brasil and contemplating a life beyond racing. Tragically he is struck down in his prime on the blackest weekend in the history of the sport, watched live on television by 300 million people. Years on he is revered in Formula One as the greatest motor racing driver of all time – and in Brasil as a Saint.Winner of the World Cinema Audience Award Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2011Kapadia on accepting the award; \"This is amazing. This festival has restored my faith in film festivals, Sundance is all about the films, the audience and the film makers. Every single screening is sold out. We were told that no one in the US knew who Ayrton Senna was, that there was no interest in Formula One, that we should forget about releasing the film here, so to win the Audience Award at Sundance is just fantastic, it makes us feel so proud. We hope this shows that there is an audience for SENNA in the US, both fans and people who have never heard of him before and I hope this is just the beginning of a long journey for SENNA in 2011.”Winner of Best Documentary – Audience Award at the Adelaide Film Festival 2011Senna has been released in Japan and in Brazil where it had one of the biggest openings for a documentary film ever.The film will be released in UK, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, S. Korea, USA and around the world during 2011.Description above from the Wikipedia article Asif Kapadia, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Gábor Bódy (30 August 1946 – 24 October 1985) was a Hungarian film director, screenwriter, theoretic, and occasional actor. A pioneer of experimental filmmaking and film language, Bódy is one of the most important figures of Hungarian cinema.Bódy was born in Budapest, in an urban middle-class family. He studied history and philosophy at Loránd Eötvös University and later filmmaking at the Academy for Theater and Film Arts. During his university days he became an influential member of the Béla Balázs Stúdió (BBS). He made his first film A Harmadik (The Third) (a documentary about students preparing an adaptation of Faust on stage) in 1971. He established various experimental and avantgarde projects at BBS including the Film Language Series in 1973 and the K/3 experimental film group in 1976, reshaping the postwar Hungarian avantgarde film\u0027s path.In 1975 he completed his debut feature at BBS, which was also his graduation thesis film at the university. Amerikai Anzix (American Torso) won the Grand Prize for best new filmmaker at International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg and the Hungarian Film Critics prize for best first film. The film which depicts the lives of Hungarian 1848 Revolution veterans in the American Civil War features Bódy\u0027s experimentalism at the fullest. The whole film was re-edited using his own method called \"light editing\" in order to make it resemble a wracked silent film from the late 19th century.His next feature Nárcisz és Psyché was the largest-scale Hungarian production of its era. This epic production based on Sándor Weöres\u0027s poetic work Psyché starred Patricia Adriani, Udo Kier and György Cserhalmi and exists in three versions: an original 210min two part version, a 136min version for foreign distribution and a 270min three part television version.  In 1980 Bódy began to work on the first international video magazine INFERMENTAL and managed to publish the first of 10 issues (plus one special issue) while on a residency at DAAD Berliner Küunstlerprogram in 1982. The series published featured a range of guest editors and in total included work from over 1500 artists from 36 countries and was published up to 1991.After many frustrated projects Bódy managed to complete what was to become his final feature film Kutya éji dala (Dog\u0027s Night Song). Bódy cast himself as the lead in this ambitious and influential feature which incorporated Super8 and video footage as well as a range of Hungarian underground punk bands (Galloping Coroners, Trabant) of the time in order to a film \"deeply rooted in the fundamentals of today\u0027s reality.\"In 1985 Bódy died under sketchy circumstances. A later published information (2001) hints his earlier collaboration (1973–1983) with the Hungarian Secret Police, the III/III. Authorities of the time (Hungary was then considered a \u0027satellite\u0027 country of the Soviet Union) stated that he had killed himself. His widow instead preferred a charge of murder against certain unidentified parties. No official investigation followed and Bódy\u0027s fate remains a mystery to this day.Description above from the Wikipedia article Gábor Bódy, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Wojciech Jerzy Has was a Polish film director, screenwriter and film producer.Wojciech Jerzy Has was born in Kraków, with Jewish origin on his father\u0027s side, and Roman Catholic on his mother\u0027s. During the wartime German occupation of Poland, Has studied at the Kraków Business and Commerce College and later clandestine underground classes at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts - until it was disbanded in 1943. When the war ended, he went on to study at the reconstituted Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. In 1946, Has completed a one-year course in film and began producing educational and documentary films at the Warsaw Documentary Film Studio, and in the 1950s moved on to work at Poland\u0027s premier filmmaking academy, the National Film Studio, in Łódź.Has made his debut with Harmony (Harmonia, 1948), a medium-length feature, and began making full-length feature films in 1957. In 1974, he was appointed as professor in the directing department at the National Film School in Łódź. Throughout his long and prolific career, he directed such notable films as The Saragossa Manuscript, The Doll and The Hour-Glass Sanatorium (also known as The Sandglass).Early on in his career, Has gained a reputation as an individualist who avoided political overtones in his art. He produced his most important films throughout the period when the Polish Film School was at its most prominent; however, his work possessed its own stylistic feeling that was independent of the over policial themes that dominated the prevailing Polish School. In practically every film, Has sought to create hermetic environments, in which the problems and storylines of his protagonists were always of secondary importance to the particular world he had created, characterized by an accumulation of random objects that formed unique visual universe.Has\u0027s oeuvre is commonly associated with Surrealist painting in Polish criticism. This is reinforced by the director\u0027s dream poetic and his use of objects, which are also characteristic of many canvasses by the Surrealists. Has also created a number of intimate psychological dramas during his career, such as How to Be Loved and Farewells, focusing on damaged individuals who have difficulty settling into life. In his work, he was fascinated by outsiders and people incapable of finding their place in reality.Two currents remain evident in Has\u0027s output: one was his cinema of psychological analysis, the other his films of visionary form, in which he most often used the motif of a journey.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Kenneth Johnson (born 26 October 1942) is an American screenwriter, producer and director best known as the creator of the V science fiction franchise and The Incredible Hulk TV series. His creative efforts are almost entirely concentrated in the area of television science fiction.A native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Johnson is a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. His early TV work includes The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and The Incredible Hulk. Johnson created the character of Jaime Sommers and the Bionic Woman series.In 1983, he wrote and directed the original miniseries V, about an invasion of Earth by reptilian aliens. The miniseries aired on NBC, and a year later was followed by a sequel, V: The Final Battle, which Johnson briefly worked on before leaving the project due to disagreements with the network. Johnson was subsequently credited as a co-writer of the sequel miniseries under the pseudonym Lillian Weezer, and was not involved at all in the weekly V television series that followed.In 1989, he produced the television series Alien Nation based on the 1988 film of the same name.In 1997, he wrote and directed the movie Steel, based on the DC comic book character Steel. It featured basketball player Shaquille O\u0027Neal as John Henry Irons, the character\u0027s alter-ego.In 2006, Johnson announced his completion of a four hour script for a new V mini series called V: The Second Generation. The storyline takes place 20 years after the original 1983 mini-series, ignoring the second mini-series (V: The Final Battle) and subsequent weekly television series. However, NBC told Johnson that they were more interested in a remake of the original V mini-series instead, which, if successful, might lead to his proposed sequel.Since then, Johnson adapted his screenplay for V: The Second Generation into a novel. It was published by Tor Books and released on February 5, 2008. However, since his discussions with NBC, Warner Bros (who hold the television rights to the V franchise) have opted to produce a remake of V (written by Scott Peters) for the ABC Network, thus ending any prospect of Johnson\u0027s sequel being produced for television.In April 2008, Johnson stated his intention to remake the original V mini-series and his new sequel V: The Second Generation into feature films. Johnson claimed to have been in discussions with producers interested in the project, though was extremely vague:\"... since I own the motion picture rights to V, we’re in the process to do a remake of the original mini-series first as a theatrical feature, which I’m so jazzed about because it will give me an opportunity to really realize it and execute it in a way that was impossible to do back then. Then that will lead to the obvious sequel, because it is a franchise, and then we’ll get into The Second Generation and I\u0027m hoping we’ll be able to do two movies, because there’s certainly enough material in the novel to warrant two separate sequels. That’s my goal at this point and that’s what we’re in the process of doing. I just literally came from a meeting, 15–20 minutes ago with a fellow in Beverly Hills who really says that we’re gonna do it.\"However, since this statement, Johnson\u0027s potential film production has not been developed further, whilst Warner Bros\u0027 television remake for ABC premiered on November 3, 2009.Description above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Johnson (producer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He later attended a film school designed to give students practical experience and preparation for a career in the film business. He learned the ropes firsthand while working in the camera department on many commercials, music videos, and television shows such as The Adventures of the Black Stallion starring Mickey Rooney.During this time, Elkayem also made several short films with support and financial assistance from the New Zealand government. His big break came with Larger than Life, a 13-minute black-and-white, FX-driven homage to the 1950s Hollywood horror genre, featuring a giant, man-eating spider.Produced by Academy Award winner Jamie Selkirk, and financed with the largest grant of its kind from the New Zealand Film Commission, Larger than Life received critical acclaim at the 1998 Telluride Film Festival and later caught the eye of the Hollywood producers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow), who then recruited Elkayem to write and direct Eight Legged Freaks, a $30 million feature film based on Larger than Life, starring David Arquette, Kari Wührer, and Scarlett Johansson, and distributed by Warner Brothers.He has since worked on a number of low-budget horror films, including Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis and Return of the Living Dead: Rave from the Grave sequels and has just finished directing Without a Paddle: Nature\u0027s Calling.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ellory Elkayem , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His work often explores themes of alienation and isolation, featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy or other power structures. Egoyan\u0027s films often follow non-linear plot-structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information.In 2008 he received the Dan David Prize for \"Creative Rendering of the Past\".Description above from the Wikipedia article Atom Egoyan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He was the winner of the Palme d\u0027Or, the highest prize at the Cannes Film Festival, in 2014. He is married to filmmaker, photographer, and actress Ebru Ceylan, with whom he co-starred in Climates (2006).Ceylan\u0027s films deal with the estrangement of the individual, existentialism, the monotony of human lives, and the details of everyday life. He uses static shots and long takes, usually in natural settings, as well as play with sound, including the use of menacing silences. He is known for filming his protagonist from behind, which, in his view, leaves the audiences to speculate on the brooding emotions of characters whose faces are obscured. Until Climates, Ceylan\u0027s films are made on low budgets, with casts generally consisting of amateur actors, most of whom are family members.",

Panom went to university where he studied a variety of martial arts, from tae kwondo to judo. It was not long before Panom would get work, doubling for Robin Shou and James Remar in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997), and when his demo reel was seen by director Prachya Pinkaew, the film Ong-bak (2003) was created for Panom, who is now going by the name of Tony Jaa in hopes of bringing his style of action to international audiences. ",

The three worked together on a number of classic Disney shorts, including The Band Concert, Music Land, and Elmer Elephant and in all, Reitherman worked on various Disney feature films produced from 1937 to 1981, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Slave in the Magic Mirror) to The Fox and the Hound (co-producer). He did the climatic dinosaur fight in Igor Stravinsky\u0027s The Rite of Spring in Fantasia, the Headless Horseman chase in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" section in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, the Crocodile in Peter Pan, and Maleficent as a dragon in Sleeping Beauty (the former three he animated and the latter he directed). Beginning with 1961\u0027s One Hundred and One Dalmatians, \"Woolie\", as he was called by friends, served as Disney\u0027s chief animation director. One of Reitherman\u0027s productions, the 1968 short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also served as a producer and sequence director, and starred as himself in the 1941 feature film The Reluctant Dragon. All three of Reitherman\u0027s sons — Bruce, Richard and Robert — provided voices for Disney characters, including Mowgli in The Jungle Book, Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, and Wart in The Sword in the Stone.Reitherman directed several Disney animated feature films including, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970),Robin Hood (1973) and The Rescuers (1977). He is also known for reusing animation in movies directed by him. According to Floyd Norman, this was just one of his trademarks, and had nothing to do with time or cost savings: \"Woolie was our director on The Jungle Book. Reuse was just Woolie’s thing. He never did it to save money. I really don’t think the “Old Guard” ever had any interest in saving money. I was never a big fan of reuse, but it wasn’t my place to tell these old guys what to do. One final thought. It never seemed to bother Walt, and I never heard him complain about reuse.\" -From Wikipedia entry",

A few of his films such as The Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity (1995) feature groundbreaking computer animation and visual effects. The Lawnmower Man is considered the first, seminal film to feature \"Virtual Reality\" as a cautionary tale becoming the number one commercially successful independent film of 1992, budgeted at just under $6 million and eventually earning over $150 million worldwide.Virtuosity became the first major film to feature nanotechnology set in a cyberpunk based future with Brett Leonard casting Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington together a full 12 years before they would again co-star and many Oscar nominations later in a 2007 project.His work with the IMAX 3D process set him apart from most directors having gained early experience with this cutting-edge presentation medium directing T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous in IMAX 3D. The film became the first number one hit 3D movie to gross over $100 million worldwide (on IMAX screens alone).He created a sensation when he took his “Swarm Cam-Fusion Station” onto The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and guest Billy Idol, and implemented one of the first live web-casts ever, from the House of Blues, LA.Creative Artists Agency and Intel Corporation hired him to direct a state-of-the-art \"interactive show\" for the CAA/Intel Media Lab to introduce the Hollywood community to the \"future of entertainment\" digitizing actor Danny DeVito, and using live performance animation to create the interactive animated character \"Mr. Head\", who guided the audience/participants through the experience.In the music video genre Brett directed Peter Gabriel\u0027s: Kiss That Frog, the first all computer graphic (CGI) music video / motion simulator ride film to tour the world becoming the wildly popular themed entertainment attraction to win him a 1994 MTV Music Video Award.

The following year The Pink Panther Strikes Again (staring Sellers) was released, containing many similarities to Goscinny\u0027s script.

He produced the 1973 movie The Sting, for which he shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with Michael Phillips and Julia Phillips. The Sting became one of the highest grossing films in history.He majored in English and art at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, from which he graduated in 1962. Bill began his career as an actor in the 60s, first appearing on screen as Frank Sinatra\u0027s ingenuous younger brother in Come Blow Your Horn (1963). Bill specialized in likeable but none-too-bright juveniles and young leads. His acting credits include None But the Brave (1965), You\u0027re A Big Boy Now (1966), Never a Dull Moment (1968), Ice Station Zebra (1968), Shampoo (1975), The Little Dragons (1980), Pee-wee\u0027s Big Adventure (1985), and Less Than Zero (1987).Bill continued to act in TV-movies, miniseries, and guest spots though with decreasing frequency as he segued into directing. He appeared in the 1966 episode \"Chaff In The Wind\" of the long running western The Virginian. He then appeared in 1967 episode \"The Predators\" of NBC\u0027s western series The Road West starring Barry Sullivan.In 1980, Bill directed his first film, My Bodyguard. From there he went on to direct Six Weeks (1982), Five Corners (1987), Crazy People (1990) A Home of Our Own (1993), and Flyboys (2006) which Bill claims was one of the first features shot entirely with digital cameras. In television Bill directed Truman Capote\u0027s One Christmas, Harlan County War, and Pictures of Hollis Woods, among others.In 2009, Bill published the book Movie Speak: How to Talk Like You Belong on a Film Set. The book traces the etymology of the language of the movie set and is filled out with stories from the Bill\u0027s career in film.From 1984-2000, he co-owned with Dudley Moore the celebrated 72 Market Street, a restaurant in Venice, California.He is married to his second wife, the former Helen Buck Bartlett, his producer/partner in Barnstorm Films in Venice.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she received her degree from the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. While a student there, she made three short films, including The Green Hour, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002.A year earlier, she had won the Slamdance Screenplay Competition for her first feature-length project, The Woodsman, adapted from Steven Fechter\u0027s 1997 minimalist play she had seen staged at The Actors Studio in New York City. Her enthusiasm for it convinced Lee Daniels, one of the producers of Monster\u0027s Ball, to help her get funding for the film version. When he approached Kevin Bacon, the actor was so impressed by the script, about a convicted child molester forced to deal with social prejudice and the fear he will not be able to control his dark urges after he\u0027s released from prison, that he suggested he star in the movie opposite wife Kyra Sedgwick. The Woodsman competed at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival, was featured in the Director’s Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival, and eventually was released to the public in 2004. Kassell\u0027s second feature film, A Little Bit of Heaven, a romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson and Gael García Bernal, had its first release in February 2011 in the UK.Kassell has directed episodes of the series Cold Case and 3 lbs (both on CBS), The Closer (on TNT) and The Killing (on AMC). She has adapted Arthur Miller\u0027s play The Ride Down Mt. Morgan for the big screen. At present, the project is in pre-production with a cast that includes Diane Keaton, Emily Blunt, and Michael Douglas, who is serving as executive producer. She also is writing an adaptation of the book Bad Medicine for HBO.",

He would go on to successfully direct the following sequels, Friday the 13th Part 2 and its 3D sequel Friday the 13th Part III. To this day, Steve Miner is the only director to direct more than one film in the Friday the 13th series. In 1986, he directed the horror comedy House which featured his real life son playing a kid who the main character (played by William Katt) must protect from monsters. In later years, Miner would direct Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, and Lake Placid. Miner directed the 2008 film Day of the Dead, a remake of the George A. Romero film of the same name.

Adam Rifkin is a writer/director/producer/actor whose eclectic career ranges from broad family comedies to cult classics to dark and gritty urban dramas. Rifkin is best known in Hollywood circles for writing family-friendly comedies like Mousehunt and 2007\u0027s Underdog. Most recently Rifkin wrote, executive produced and directed all 11 episodes of Look for Showtime. Based on his award winning film of the same name, LOOK is a drama that takes the viewer into the foreboding world of hidden cameras. Armed with the knowledge that Americans are captured on surveillance cameras more than 300 times a day, the topical series, like the film, tells its story exclusively through the eyes of the security cameras, web cams, and cell phone cameras Americans live in front of everyday, bringing to light the realities of what it means to be watched in a camera consumed culture.Description above from the Wikipedia article Adam Rifkin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He collaborated with Adam Sandler (executive producer of \"Grandma\u0027s Boy\") on the album \"Shhh...Don\u0027t Tell\" as a writer and co-producer in addition to performing on the track \"Gay Robot\".Goossen directed the music video for the album\u0027s first single \"Secret\". It features Adam Sandler and comedian Nick Swardson (Co-writer and star of \"Grandma\u0027s Boy\") singing about the benefits of having trimmed pubic hair.Goossen\u0027s previous credits include the short film A Day With the Meatball, which once again featured Sandler but focused primarily on his bulldog Meatball. The two minute piece showcases the dog meandering around various places until he ends up back in his master\u0027s arms. It was shown in theaters around the United States in 2002 as an attachment to Sandler\u0027s animated film \"Eight Crazy Nights\".Goossen helped create Sandler\u0027s official website and directed several short films for the site.Goossen is currently filming his next project, \"The Shortcut\" in Saskatchewan, Canada. The film tells the story of two brothers who learn first hand about an urban legend surrounding a shortcut near their school.In 2010, Goossen was the director of a Times Square interactive billboard installation for retailer Forever 21 which was developed by space150; the installation received media coverage for being \"a clever, fresh project\", but later, coverage focused on its similarities to Chris O\u0027Shea\u0027s 2009 project in London.Description above from the Wikipedia article Nicholaus Goossen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

Also on staff at The Lantern at the time was Jeff Smith, later known for the comic book Bone.After college, while still living in Columbus, Ohio, Kammerud and Smith formed the Character Builders animation studio. There Kammerud began working on Rover Dangerfield and worked as an animator and storyboard artist for Bebe\u0027s Kids as well as Space Jam. He became involved with Disney as sequence director for the additional animation in Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and later joined to direct and design the new characters in The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. His next film as director was 101 Dalmatians II: Patch\u0027s London Adventure, when he also worked on part of the screenplay. His second film where he worked on the screenplay was Tarzan II, in addition to producing the film, and his most recent project, The Fox and the Hound 2 is his first film without co-direction from Brian Smith.

White claimed that many key elements from the film were borrowed from Lam\u0027s City on Fire (1987 film), a claim he attempted to back up by making a comparison of the two films within a film of his own titled, \"Who Do You Think You\u0027re Fooling?More recently, White began his own film podcast, titled The Projection Booth.White also recently released a collection of his Cashiers du Cinemart articles and interviews in book form as Impossibly Funky: A Cashiers du Cinemart Collection.Description above from the Wikipedia article Mike White, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew.In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Dai Goh\", meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Dai Goh Dai\", meaning, Big, Big Brother or Biggest Big Brother.Description above from the Wikipedia article Sammo Hung, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He studied theatre at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and studied further at the Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design. He began as a theatre director and playwright in the mid 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s his career moved between work for the theatre and making films for BBC Television, many of which were characterized by a gritty \"kitchen sink realism\" style. His well-known films include Life is Sweet (1990), the comedy-drama Career Girls (1997), the Gilbert and Sullivan biopic Topsy Turvy (1999), and the bleak working-class drama All or Nothing (2002). His most notable works are arguably Naked (1993) for which he won the Best Director Award at Cannes, the BAFTA-winning (and Oscar-nominated) Palme d\u0027Or winner Secrets \u0026 Lies (1996) and Golden Lion winner Vera Drake (2004).His films and stage plays, according to the critic Michael Coveney, \"comprise a distinctive, homogenous body of work which stands comparison with anyone\u0027s in the British theatre and cinema over the same period.\"  Coveney further noted Leigh\u0027s role in helping to create stars – Liz Smith in Hard Labour, Alison Steadman in Abigail\u0027s Party, Brenda Blethyn in Grown-Ups, Antony Sher in Goose-Pimples, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth in Meantime, Jane Horrocks in Life is Sweet, David Thewlis in Naked – and remarked that the list of actors who have worked with him over the years – including Sheila Kelley, Paul Jesson, Phil Daniels, Lindsay Duncan, Lesley Sharp, Kathy Burke, Stephen Rea, Eric Richard, Julie Walters – \"comprises an impressive, almost representative, nucleus of outstanding British acting talent.\"  Ian Buruma, writing in the New York Review of Books in January 1994, noted: \"It is hard to get on a London bus or listen to the people at the next table in a cafeteria without thinking of Mike Leigh. Like other wholly original artists, he has staked out his own territory. Leigh\u0027s London is as distinctive as Fellini\u0027s Rome or Ozu\u0027s Tokyo.\"Description above from the Wikipedia article Mike Leigh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Initially Zoltan Korda functioned as a camera operator then for a time worked in film editing and as a screenwriter. In 1918 and 1920 in Hungary, he directed two silent film shorts and a feature-length silent film in Germany in 1927. In London, he made his English-language directorial debut with the sound drama Men of Tomorrow (1932) then gained wide respect for the adventure film Sanders of the River (1935), starring Paul Robeson and Leslie Banks. The film proved a significant commercial and critical success, giving Korda the first of his four nominations for \"Best Film\" at the Venice Film Festival. Korda and Robert Flaherty won the Venice festival\u0027s \"Best Director\" award for Elephant Boy (1937).A former cavalry officer, Korda made a number of military action/adventure films, many of which were filmed in Africa or India. As someone with a social conscience, his film projects often reflected that perspective when dealing with the indigenous peoples of the British Empire. Of his directorial efforts, 1939\u0027s The Four Feathers starring Sir Ralph Richardson is considered his greatest cinematic accomplishment. Of lasting significance, the film was nominated for the Palme d\u0027Or at the 1939 Cannes Film Festival and was presented again by the Festival committee in 2002 in retrospective.In 1940, Zoltan Korda joined brother Alexander in Hollywood. Working through United Artists, he served as executive producer of The Thief of Bagdad. Zoltan Korda spent the rest of his life in southern California, making another seven films including the acclaimed 1943 World War II drama, Sahara (1943), for which he wrote the screenplay and which starred Humphrey Bogart, and A Woman\u0027s Vengeance (1947) with Charles Boyer and Jessica Tandy.Korda was married to Joan Gardner (1930 - 13 October 1961) till his death and had a son, David. The entire family\u0027s colorful history is the subject of a book by Zoltan\u0027s nephew Michael Korda, Charmed Lives.Poor health, brought on years earlier from a battle with tuberculosis, forced Zoltan Korda\u0027s retirement in 1955. He died in 1961 in Hollywood after a lengthy illness and was interred there in the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery.Description above from the Wikipedia article Zoltan Korda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaKristian Levring is a Danish director born in 1957 in Denmark. He was the fourth signatory of Dogme95. He lived eight years in France. He graduated in editing at the National Film School of Denmark and has edited a large number of documentaries and feature films besides directing two feature films, among these, Et skud fra hjertet (1986). He is the recipient of some 23 Danish and international awards for his commercials. The King is Alive (Dogme 4) is his third feature film. The King is Alive tells the story of a mixed group of tourists in Namibia, Africa, whose bus breaks down in a remote, abandoned village (formerly a mining town). Facing starvation, dehydration, cabin fever, and death, one of the group decides to stage a production of Shakespeare\u0027s King Lear and casts the others as characters. As the thin veneer of civilized behavior breaks down, the group experiences the absurdity of putting on a play (for no audience except one lone indigenous man) in such dire and fatal circumstances. Filmed in stark digital and adhering to the tenets of Dogme filmmaking, The King is Alive is a fascinating study in the dark heart of people under extreme stress. Herzogian in its theme and mood, the film\u0027s location (remote Namibia) is as much a character in the film as the actors, like the space ship in Ridley Scott\u0027s Alien. The King is Alive features Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Brion James (Blade Runner\u0027s \"Leon\"; Cabin Boy). Dark, tense, and desperate, it stands as a powerful piece of filmmaking. Levring\u0027s next film after The King is Alive is called The Intended and features some of the same actors from the former. Set in the jungle of Borneo in the 1920s, it concerns an isolated English settlement/ivory trading station. Similar in nature to The King is Alive, it focuses on what happens to small isolated groups under both internal psychological pressure and external pressure from the environment around them. As The King is Alive was filmed by Dogme rules and restrictions, The Intended instead has steady camera shots (rather than shaky/handheld) and ambient music throughout. Subtle yet powerful, the film explores Conradian contexts through the lens of a female perspective. Its influence can be seen in the Australian frontier film The Proposition.Description above from the Wikipedia article Kristian Levring, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaNacho Cerdà (born 1969) is a Spanish film director best known for his controversial 1994 film, \u0027Aftermath\u0027. One year after producing that movie, he was accused of being the person behind the infamous alien autopsy footage. However, this accusation has been withdrawn since after Ray Santilli was found to be the director.Aftermath is the second in a trilogy of short films known as \u0027La Trilogia De La Muerte\u0027 (The Trilogy of Death). The first film, \u0027Awakening\u0027, runs for only 8 minutes. Created in 1990, it tells of a boy for whom time stops upon falling asleep in a classroom, only later realising that he had actually died and was experiencing an out-of-body phenomena. The 1994 sequel, \u0027Aftermath\u0027, runs at a significantly longer time of 32 minutes, which depicts defilement, mutilation, and necrophilia (see Necrophilia in popular culture for more). The 35 minute finale, \u0027Genesis\u0027 (1998), shows the life of a sculptor whose artwork comes to life while he turns to stone, his work gradually consuming him. The trilogy represents the three stages of life, and in each instance, Cerdà shows how vulnerable we are to the whims of elements beyond our control; time, others, and material possessions respectively.Cerdà also directed The Abandoned which is about an American film producer who returns to her homeland, Russia, to discover the truth about her family history. The film was first released in the US as part of the After Dark Horrorfest in November 2006. The film received a stand alone release in theaters in February 2007. The DVD was released on June 19, 2007.Description above from the Wikipedia article Nacho Cerdà, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Sarkies grew up in the South Island city of Dunedin, and his two feature films released to date have been set in Dunedin, or close by. He began making short films as a teenager with fellow filmmaker Simon Perkins. After winning an international award for his short Dream-makers, Sarkies began work on his most ambitious short to date: the adventure comedy Signing Off (1996), which won four international awards and helped attract funding for Scarfies(1999), Sarkies\u0027 feature film debut. Sarkies co-wrote the Scarfies script with his younger brother, playwright and performer Duncan Sarkies. Winner of seven awards including Best Picture and Best Director at the NZ Film Awards, the film is part comedy, part thriller, and partly a celebration of being a university student in Dunedin. Scarfies was later released on video in the United States under the title Crime 101. Sarkies\u0027 second feature is the true-life thriller Out of the Blue based on the 1990 Aramoana Massacre, in which a gunman killed thirteen people in a seaside town not far from Dunedin. The film emphasizes realism over melodrama, partly through handheld camerawork and a naturalistic acting style. Some of those living in Aromoana expressed opposition to the film being made; others who lost people in the tragedy agreed to do interviews with scriptwriters Sarkies and Graeme Tetley. In New Zealand, Out of the Blue went on to become the tenth most successful local film yet released theatrically (not accounting for inflation), and win six Qantas Film and Television Awards in September 2008, including \"Best Picture - budget over $1 million\". As of October 2008, Out of the Blue\u0027s rating on critics\u0027 website Rotten Tomatoes was 91 per cent. Before the making of Out of the Blue, the Sarkies brothers worked together on the script for a fantasy film called The Magnificent Magic Fingers. The budget for Magic Fingers was estimated to be at least NZ$20 million. It is not yet clear whether Magic Fingers will join Peter Jackson\u0027s unmade Blubberhead as one of the great fantasy films that never quite emerged from down under. In 2010, the TV series This Is Not My Life, directed by Sarkies, debuted on New Zealand Television. Hopefully Robert will be considering a major role for Andy Faulkner, who he directed to great comedic effect in a 2006 TVC for Ford Fairmont Ghia.Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Sarkies, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He attended the University of California, Los Angeles but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year. As an unpaidintern for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called Swings. This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched Racing with the Moon (1984).His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision. Kloves wrote The Fabulous Baker Boys and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989. The Fabulous Baker Boys did reasonably well, but his next shot as writer/director for Flesh and Bone in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.Realizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting Michael Chabon\u0027s novel Wonder Boys into a screenplay. Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work. This was his first try at adapting another work to film. His screenplay was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award after the film\u0027s release in 2000.Warner Bros. sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included the first Harry Potter novel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs. He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. After Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.As of 2011, Kloves is working on a film adaptation of Mark Haddon\u0027s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which he will write and direct. He has also a draft written of the yet unproduced fantasy film Akira.",

He wrote the latter\u0027s sequel, and most recently wrote and directed Starship Troopers 3: Marauder.Neumeier studied journalism at the University of California at Santa Cruz then attended the School of Motion Picture and Television at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). After completing his bachelor\u0027s degree at UCLA, Newmeier started work in the Hollywood film business, as a production assistant on the TV series Taxi, a proof-reader for Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures; and as a junior executive at the Universal Pictures company.Neumeier wrote his first outlines and film treatments for his first movie, RoboCop, as well as \"spec\" scripts. He declined an offer of a vice-presidency at Universal Pictures, to develop the screenplay for RoboCop, with Michael Miner.The rights to the screenplay were bought up by the Orion Pictures company, and was granted a budget of just under $15 million. Paul Verhoeven was assigned to make the movie.Neumeier also co-produced RoboCop, which was released in movie theaters in 1987 in North America and some other locations. This movie was a success, and it drew just over 50 million dollars\u0027 worth of ticket sales in the United States, alone. The success of RoboCop also motivated the production of two sequels, RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3, and also two TV series, one live-action and one animated. Most of the creators of RoboCop had left before the production of these sequels.The first sequel to RoboCop, RoboCop 2, was planned to have its screenplay written by Neumeier. He had written a first draft of a screenplay for RoboCop 2, when a screenwriters\u0027 strike occurred. It prevented Neumeier from writing any more of the screenplay. The Orion Pictures company next decided to hire the comic book artist Frank Miller to work on his own screenplay for RoboCop 2.A decade after the first RoboCop movie was produced, Neumeier rejoined Paul Verhoeven to work on Starship Troopers, which was adapted from the novel with the same name by Robert A. Heinlein in 1959. With violence and satire thrown into a story of efforts by the human race to insure its survival (in ways similar to RoboCop at times, Starship Troopers seemed to have been more successful in Europe, Asia, etc., than in North America where it drew gross ticket sales of about $54 million at theaters, although Artforum magazine selected this film as one of the \"10 most artistic [film] achievements of 1997\". Neumeier also appeared in this film in the brief role of a man convicted of murder and sentenced to immediate execution. Description above from the Wikipedia article Edward Neumeier, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Forsyth first came to attention with a low-budget film, That Sinking Feeling, made with youth theatre actors and featuring a cameo appearance by the Edinburgh gallery owner Richard Demarco. The relative success of the film was carried to a far higher level by his next film Gregory\u0027s Girl in 1981. This featured some of the same young actors, in particular John Gordon Sinclair, as well as the acting debut of Clare Grogan. The film was a major hit and won \u0027Best Screenplay\u0027 in that year\u0027s BAFTA Awards. In 1983 he wrote and directed the successful Local Hero, produced by David Puttnam, and featuring Burt Lancaster. It was rated in the top 100 films of the 1980s in a Premiere magazine recap of the decade. Forsyth\u0027s next film was the 1984 Comfort and Joy, about a Glasgow radio DJ caught between rival ice cream companies, which again featured Clare Grogan. When Puttnam went to Hollywood, Forsyth followed, but had limited success. The 1987 Housekeeping was his first American film. Another movie, Being Human, was shelved by the studio for four years after Puttnam was ousted. Gregory\u0027s Two Girls from 2000 appeared as a sequel to Gregory\u0027s Girl, with John Gordon Sinclair playing the same character, but it received mixed reviews. In a June 2009 interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, Forsyth stated that he is currently working on a new film project with the working title of Exile.Description above from the Wikipedia article Bill Forsyth, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Erik Balling was one of the most beloved Danish filmmaker in the 20th century. Balling was a director, a producer and a writer. Erik Balling was mostly famous for creating such TV epics as \"Matador\" and \"Huset På Christianshavn\" and the film-series of \"Olsen banden\". Erik Balling was born the 19th of November 1925 in the Danish city of Nyborg, as a son of a priest. In 1946 Balling was hired as an assistant at \"Nordisk Film Kompagni\" - the world\u0027s oldest film production company. His talent was soon recognised, and Balling soon had the opportunity to work as a director. His debut as a director came in 1952, with the film: \"Vi arme syndere\". Balling soon gained a reputation of having good technical skills, and after that film his talent was widely recognised. In 1957 he became head of \"Nordisk Film\" - the youngest one ever. Balling was mostly famous for his comedies. In his early days he directed Poeten og Lillemor (1959) and Sommer i Tyrol (1964), which were very popular at the time. In the middle of the 1960s Balling tried to chance his style when it came to comedies. At this time the popular James Bond films circled the globe, Balling\u0027s next film was inspired by those films, teaming up with Henning Bahs to make the Jamed Bond spoof \"Slå Først Frede\" (1965), which became very popular in Denmark - so popular it spawned a sequel Slap af, Frede! (1966). This co-work with Henning Bahs was so fruitful that they made many more movies together. This co-work eventually led to film-series of \"Olsen banden\", which started with Olsen-banden (1968) - and eventually they made a total of 14 \"Olsen banden\" film, plus a TV series and a movie version where the characters in \"Olsen banden\" are children. \"Olsen banden\" was about a small band of small time criminals, trying to become millionaires. \"Olsen banden\" were not only very popular in Denmark, but also in East-Germany, Poland, Sweden and Norway - especially in Norway and Sweden, who eventually made their own national versions of \"Olsen banden\", namely the Norwegian \"Olsen banden\" and the Swedish \"Jönssonligan\" - Henning Bahs and Erik Balling also helped the Norwegians and the Swedes to write those. In that late 60s and early 70s Balling made the popular Danish TV series \"Huset På Christianshavn\", which also became the basis for a movie: \"Ballade på Christianshavn (1971)\".In 1970 Balling produced the very popular Danish TV epic \"Matador\". More than fifty percent of Denmark\u0027s population watched \"Matador\" in those days. \"Matador\" was about life in a smaller city in Denmark in the 30s and 40s.Balling was always known for his warm style, when he portrayed humans. Throughout his life, he received many prizes. He was 80 years old when he died the 19th of November 2005.",

His feature films include Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, winner of the prestigious 2010 Cannes Film Festival Palme d\u0027Or prize; Tropical Malady, which won a jury prize at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; Blissfully Yours, which won the top prize in the Un Certain Regard program at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival; and Syndromes and a Century, which premiered at the 63rd Venice Film Festival and was the first Thai film to be entered in competition there. Working outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system, Weerasethakul has directed several features and dozens of short films. Themes reflected in his films (frequently discussed in interviews) include dreams, nature, sexuality (including his own homosexuality), and Western perceptions of Thailand and Asia, and his films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures (like placing titles/credits at the middle of a film) and for working with non-actors. Cinephiles affectionately refer to him as \"Joe\" (a nickname that he, like many with similarly long Thai names, has adopted out of convenience).Description above from the Wikipedia article Apichatpong  Weerasethakul, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was Visual Effects Supervisor and Second Unit Director on the 2001 Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay action drama Pearl Harbor.Since his film school days at UCLA Brevig had been fascinated with the potential of 3D for live-action movie production, and he learned everything he could about it. During the production of 1986\u0027s Captain EO short for the Disney theme parks he was substantially responsible for supervising the technical aspects of the 3D photography. After several second unit director\u0027s assignments in special effects-heavy films like Men in Black and Michael Bay\u0027s Pearl Harbor, Brevig\u0027s previous 3D experience and expertise turned out to be the factor that helped him get his first full-blown director\u0027s job when he was offered the chance to direct the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D (a New Line Cinema release), the first narrative feature shot entirely in digital 3-D. He next directed Yogi Bear, another 3-D movie, for Warner Bros., and he is attached to direct a 3-D Korean War drama, 17 Days of Winter, about the 1950 Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 17 Days of Winter, expected to cost $80–100 million, is scheduled to shoot in Korea and New Zealand over the winter of 2010-2011 for 2012 release.Description above from the Wikipedia article Eric Brevig, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Kurt Neumann (5 April 1908, Nuremberg, Germany - 21 August 1958, Los Angeles) was a german Hollywood film director who specialized in science fiction movies in his later career. Neumann came to the US in the early talkie era, hired to direct German language versions of Hollywood films.Once he mastered English and established himself as technically proficient in filmmaking, Neumann directed such low-budget programmers as The Big Cage (1932), Secret of the Blue Room (1933) with Paul Lukas and Gloria Stuart, Hold \u0027Em Navy (1936), It Happened in New Orleans (1936) with child star Bobby Breen, Wide Open Faces (1937) with Joe E. Brown, and Ellery Queen: Master Detective (1939).Neumann was signed by producer Hal Roach in 1941 to direct a series of \"streamliners\", 45-minute features designed to fill out short double bills. Among these 4-reel comedies were About Face (1942), Brooklyn Orchid (1942), Taxi, Mister? (1943) and Yanks Ahoy (1943).In 1945, he joined the company of producer Sol Lesser, who engaged Neumann as coproducer and principal director of the Tarzan series produced by Lesser 1945-1954. The Tarzan films were produced for RKO and starred Johnny Weissmuller and later Gordon Scott.Neumann became known as a specialist in science fiction movies due to his producing and directing such productions as Rocketship X-M (1950) and The Fly (1958). Neumann directed other sci-fi and horror films such as Kronos (1957) and She-Devil (1957), and directed non-scifi films such as The Ring (1952) an independent feature co-starring Rita Moreno, Carnival Story (1954), Mohawk (1956), and The Deerslayer (1957)Contrary to some published reports, Neumann did not die as a result of suicide, but, rather, from natural causes in Los Angeles on 21 August 1958, shortly after a preview screening of The Fly but before the official premiere. Thus, Neumann never knew what a boxoffice hit The Fly was. He was entombed at Utter McKinley Cemetery in Los Angeles.Description above from the Wikipedia article Kurt Neumann (director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. The first full length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. After directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry. He died in Palm Springs, California in 1991.Thorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting, because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about thirteen. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe\u0027s work on the film survive today.For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.Description above from the Wikipedia article Richard Thorpe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia​",

He wrote and directed more than 20 features, documentaries, and short films, which are known for his sharp insight into post-Revolutionary Cuba, and possess a delicate balance between dedication to the revolution and criticism of the social, economic, and political conditions of the country.Gutiérrez\u0027s work is representative of a cinematic movement occurring in the 1960s and 1970s known collectively as the New Latin American Cinema. This collective movement, also referred to by various writers by specific names such as “Third Cinema”, “Cine Libre”, and “Imperfect Cinema,” was concerned largely with the problems of neocolonialism and cultural identity. The movement rejected both the commercial perfection of the Hollywood style, and the auteur-oriented European art cinema, for a cinema created as a tool for political and social change. Due not in a small part to the filmmakers’ lack of resources, aesthetic was of secondary importance to cinema’s social function. The movement\u0027s main goal was to create films in which the viewer became an active, self-aware participant in the discourse of the film. Viewers were presented with an analysis of a current problem within society that as of that time had no clear solution, hoping to make the audience aware of the problem and to leave the theater willing to become actors of social change.Description above from the Wikipedia article Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Born in Israel, Murro originally trained as an architect in his boyhood town of Jerusalem, NY, then entered the advertising industry, with a lengthy tenure in the creative department of Gotham\u0027s Goldsmith/Jeffrey Agency. During that stint, he became known for his deft and original hand at directing promotional films via his own production banner, Biscuit Films (co-run with Shawn Lacy Tessaro); their clients included such brands as Saturn, E*Trade, and FreeAgent.com. In time, Murro and Tessaro migrated to the advertising-based production house Stiefel \u0026amp; Co., in Southern California, then set up a new production banner for themselves. In the years to follow, talk swirled of Murro\u0027s pending feature activity -- including, at one point, his plans to direct The Ring Two for DreamWorks (an assignment eventually handled by Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese film) and the black comedy All Families Are Psychotic; however, Murro eventually took his first high-profile feature bow with the 2007 comedy Smart People. The film stars Thomas Haden Church, Dennis Quaid, and Sarah Jessica Parker, and concerns a professor (Quaid) who grapples with a new romance and the doings of a shady brother.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaDouglas Sweetland is an American animator/director, he grew up watching Disney films and classic Saturday morning cartoons. As a child, Doug drew cartoons for the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts for several years. After graduating high school in 1992, Doug opted to attend California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and pursue his life-long love and passion for animation.In 1994, he decided to leave school in his final year to join Pixar. His first assignment was as an animator on Toy Story. He continued as animator on A Bug\u0027s Life and Toy Story 2. He was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation for Toy Story 2. Doug continued to build an incredible reputation as one of the best animators in the business. He was awarded back to back ANNIE awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Character Animation for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. Doug took on the lead animator role for Bud Luckey’s Oscar-nominated Boundin\u0027 short and worked as an animator and storyboard artist on the Oscar-winning The Incredibles. Sweetland followed this up by stepping into the supervising animator role on John Lasseter’s Cars.In 2007, Doug pitched a short film about a sympathetic magician who gets “dumped” by his rabbit. This eventually evolved to a more slapstick film (and a throwback to Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes). Teddy Newton was brought on board to design the characters; it emerged as Sweetland’s directorial debut. Presto was very well received by audiences and critics alike when it preceded WALL-E in theaters. It was honored in 2008 with an Academy Award nomination in the Best Animated Short Film category. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008.On September 24, 2010, it was reported that Sweetland had been hired by Sony Pictures Animation to direct a computer-animated film The Familiars.Description above from the Wikipedia article Doug Sweetland, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Says Maury, \"We decided not to go to the United States to do a remake or a PG-13 movie; we want to do original things.\"Their current project Livid is set for release in 2011. The two are also set to do a segment on Paris, I\u0027ll Kill You, a horror film anthology set in Paris, France.Description above from the Wikipedia article Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJens Lien (born 14 September 1967) is a Norwegian film director. He graduated from the London International Film School in 1993. His graduation project was the short film \"Montana\", that was featured at the short film festival in Grimstad that year. in 1995 he again participated in this festival, with the entry \"Mitt elektriske kjøkken\" (My Electrical Kitchen). Lien went on to make the short films \"Døren som ikke smakk\" (Shut the Door, 2000) og \"Naturlige Briller\" (Natural Glasses, 2001). Both of these films were based on scripts by Per Schreiner, and both were featured at the Cannes International Film Festival. In addition to this Lien has also made a number of advertisements.In 2003 he had his feature film debut with the movie Jonny Vang. The movie was selected for the Berlin Film festival. The movie was awarded an Amanda Award for \"Best Actor\" (Aksel Hennie) in 2003. It was also nominated in the category \"Best Film\", but lost out to Bent Hamer\u0027s Salmer fra kjøkkenet. Lien\u0027s next major film project was Den brysomme mannen (2006). This film was again the result of a cooperation with Per Schreiner; it was based on a story originally written for radio theatre, recorded two years before it was adapted for the screen. Lien later said in an interview that the script made such a great impression on him that he was unable to sleep after first reading it. The film was awarded three Amandas in 2006: for \"Best Direction\", \"Best Screenplay\" and \"Best Actor\" (Trond Fausa Aurvåg). It was also nominated in the categories \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actress\" (Petronella Barker). Den brysomme mannen has won more than 20 international awards, including the ACID Award (Agence du Cinéma Indépendant pour sa Diffusion) at the Cannes Film Festival.Description above from the Wikipedia article Jens Lien, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Fremont High School (1926 - 1928) there with Roy Williams. Both Fremont football players, they would later be hired by Walt Disney in 1930 to work at the Walt Disney Studio on Hyperion Avenue. Often referring to himself as Kinney\u0027s best friend, Williams would go on to star as the \"Big Mooseketeer\" with head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd on the classic 1950s television program, \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (1955 - 1958).Kinney began his long career in cartoons at the Walt Disney Studios in 1931 as an animator on several shorts, including Santa\u0027s Workshop (released on December 10, 1932), The Band Concert (released on February 23, 1935), and Moose Hunters (released on April 17, 1937). He then became a director of cartoons at Disney, including as a sequence director for both Pinocchio and Dumbo and especially as a director in the shorts department, where he directed many cartoon shorts, mostly those starring Goofy (his brother Dick created the stories for the shorts), although he also directed a few Donald Duck cartoons as well, including the Academy Award-winning wartime propaganda film, Der Fuehrer\u0027s Face. He also served as director of most of the \"package films\" during the 1940s, including The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. In the mid-1950s, he supervised new animation used to tie some of the old shorts together for Disney\u0027s television efforts.In 1959, Jack left Disney to start (with his brother Dick) Jack Kinney Productions, an independent animation studio. Among other work they provided animation for King Features Syndicate\u0027s 1960 Popeye series.In 1988, Kinney published a short memoir, Walt Disney and Assorted Other Characters: An Unauthorized Account of the Early Years at Disney\u0027s.Kinney died on February 9, 1992 in Glendale, California at the age of 82.Description above from the Wikipedia article Jack Kinney, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Dan Curtis  (August 12, 1927 – March 27, 2006) was an American director and producer of television and film, probably best known for his miniseries The Winds of War and War and Remembrance and for his afternoon TV series Dark Shadows. Dark Shadows originally aired from 1966 to 1971 and has aired in syndication for nearly 40 years. Curtis was responsible for the 1991 remake of Dark Shadows, which was canceled due to low ratings. He was the executive producer for Dark Shadows for The WB Television Network; however, it was canceled before the pilot episode aired.His series of macabre films include The Night Stalker (which inspired the series Kolchak: The Night Stalker), Intruders, The Night Strangler, House of Dark Shadows, Night of Dark Shadows, Burnt Offerings, Trilogy of Terror, The Norliss Tapes (a 1973 pilot for an unproduced series starring Roy Thinnes), Curse of the Black Widow, Dead Of Night, Scream of the Wolf and others. He worked frequently with sci-fi/horror writer Richard Matheson. Curtis was producer and/or director of a number of television adaptations of horror-related productions including Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Turn of the Screw, all made between 1968 and 1975.In 1978, Curtis made a departure from his usual macabre offerings, when he wrote, produced, and directed the sentimental NBC television film When Every Day Was the Fourth of July. Although fictionalized, the film was semi-autobiographical, based on his childhood growing up in Bridgeport, Connecticut in the 1930s. The film was originally intended to be a pilot for a potential series, but when the series was not picked up by the NBC network, Curtis produced and directed the 1980 television movie sequel The Long Days of Summer, this time airing on the ABC network.His miniseries The Winds of War was nominated for four Emmy Awards.He also directed the War and Remembrance mini-series which was the continuation of The Winds of War. This mini-series was 30 hours in length and was split into two segments, Chapters I-Vll and Vll, the final chapter. This series received 15 Emmy Award nominations and won for best miniseries, special effects and single-camera production editing. The miniseries was nominated for Emmy Awards for best actor (John Gielgud), actress (Jane Seymour) and supporting actress (Polly Bergen).Curtis died of a brain tumor in his home on March 27, 2006, two weeks after the death of his wife Norma.Curtis\u0027 rights to Dark Shadows remain with his estate, who have signed a deal with Warner Bros. for a new Dark Shadows movie. The film will star Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins and is set for release in 2012.Description above from the Wikipedia article Dan Curtis, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

        "biography": "Alberto de Almeida Cavalcanti was a Brazilian-born film director and producer. He was born in Rio de Janeiro, the son of a prominent mathematician. He was a precociously intelligent child, and by the age of 15 was studying law at university. Following an argument with a professor he was expelled. His father sent him to Geneva, Switzerland on condition that he did not study law or politics. Cavalcanti chose to study architecture instead. At 18 he moved to Paris to work for an architect, later switching to working on interior design. After a visit back to Brazil he took up a position at the Brazilian consulate in Liverpool, England.Cavalcanti corresponded with Marcel L\u0027Herbier, a leading light in France\u0027s avant-garde film movement. This led to a job offer from L\u0027Herbier for Cavalcanti to work as a set designer. So, in 1920 he left his job at the Consulate and moved back to France to work for L\u0027Herbier; he was to be involved in the making of numerous films, the most notable being L\u0027Inhumaine.He was soon making his own films, in 1926 directing his first, Rien Que les Heures (Nothing But Time) — a day in the life of Paris and its citizens. In 1927 he collaborated with Walter Ruttmann on a similar project set in Berlin, called Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Big City).Cavalcanti took a job with Paramount\u0027s French studios after the talkies came in, but he found himself making more commercial films which could not hold his interest and left Paramount in 1933. In the same year he returned to England to work for John Grierson\u0027s GPO Film Unit. He was involved in many capacities, from production to sound engineer. He was to spend seven years at the GPO Film Unit, working on many projects. Much of his work at the GPO was uncredited, he acted as a mentor to many new film makers, but in 1937 he was appointed acting head of the GPO Film Unit when Grierson left for Canada. When told that the only way the position could become permanent was to become a naturalized British citizen, he decided to leave the unit.In 1940 Cavalcanti joined Ealing Studios, under the leadership of producer Michael Balcon. He worked as an art editor, producer and director. His most notable works of this period (many of them propaganda films) were Yellow Caesar (1941), Went the Day Well? (1942), Three Songs of Resistance (1943), Champagne Charlie (1944), Dead of Night (as co-director) (1945) and Nicholas Nickleby (1947). In 1946 Cavalcanti left Ealing over a dispute about money. He went on to direct three more films in the UK, before returning to Brazil in 1950.In Brazil he worked as a producer for Companhia Cinematográfica Vera Cruz; the company eventually became insolvent. After being blacklisted as a communist in Brazil, he decided to move back to Europe in 1954. He eventually settled in France, where he continued his work in television. He died in Paris in 1982 at the age of 85.",

At the end of the 1930s, he worked on documentaries for the GPO Film Unit.When his boss at the GPO Alberto Cavalcanti moved to Ealing Studios, Hamer was invited to join him there. He gained some experience as a director by substituting for colleagues and contributed the \u0027haunted mirror\u0027 sequence to Dead of Night (1945). He followed this with the three Ealing films under his own name for which he is best remembered: Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), It Always Rains on Sunday (1947), both featuring Googie Withers, and the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness.Hamer died of pneumonia at the age of 52 at St Thomas\u0027s Hospital in London. An alcoholic, who was homosexual in an era when it was taboo in the UK, Hamer\u0027s career \"now looks like the most serious miscarriage of talent in the postwar British cinema\", according to film critic David Thomson.Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Hamer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He has acted in a number of successful Norwegian movies, and has received several awards.Hennie grew up in Lambertseter in Oslo. In his late teens he was sentenced for graffiti, and became an outcast in the community for confessing to the police. This personal story contributed much of the background for the movie Uno. The conviction against Hennie was in fact one of the first such cases in Norway.Hennie was admitted to the Norwegian National Academy of Theatre after applying four times. He graduated in 2001, and has since acted both at Teatret Vårt in Molde (2001–2002) and at Oslo Nye Teater (2002–), where he has been in plays such as Hamlet, and Kvinnen som giftet seg med en kalkun (English: The woman who married a turkey).His main success, however, has been as a film actor. He made his debut starring in the feature film Jonny Vang in 2003. Though the director, Jens Lien, originally thought Hennie was too young for the role, the actor convinced him he was the right man for the film. The same year he also acted in the movies Buddy and Ulvesommer, and the next year he made his debut as a director and writer with the movie Uno, in which he also acted. For this film Hennie, and his co-star Nicolai Cleve Broch, went into hard physical training for six months to perform convincingly as bodybuilders.He won the Amanda Award – the main Norwegian film award – for \"Best Direction\" for the movie Uno in 2005, and that same year he was also among the nominees for \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Film\". He also won an Amanda award as \"Best Actor\" for the movie Jonny Vang in 2003. He was named one of European films \"Shooting Stars\" by European Film Promotion in 2004. In 2001 he was also named \"Theatre talent of the year\" by the newspaper Dagbladet. In 2008 Hennie starred in the movie Max Manus, where he played the role of the Norwegian war hero by that name. The movie had a large budget by Norwegian standards, and was met with great expectations. His next upcoming international film is Age of Heroes, a world war 2 movie primarily shot in Norway starring Sean Bean and Danny Dyer.Description above from the Wikipedia article Aksel Hennie, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

(born November 21, 1935) is an American cinematographer whose prominence owes most to his innovative work of the 1970s and 1980s. He began his career as a camera operator, distinguishing himself on Steven Spielberg\u0027s Jaws. As a cinematographer, he became famous for his two collaborations with Martin Scorsese, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Chapman was also cinematographer for the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Chapman\u0027s style tends towards high contrasts and aggressive use of strong colors. He is also extremely adept at setting up complex camera movements quickly and improvising on the set. This style is epitomized in the boxing sequences in Raging Bull, during which the camera was often strapped to the actors through improvised rigs. Chapman was also the principal cinematographer on Scorsese\u0027s documentary The Last Waltz. Besides his work with Scorsese, Chapman has worked as Director of Photography for directors Hal Ashby, Philip Kaufman, Martin Ritt, Robert Towne, Michael Caton-Jones, Andrew Davis, and Ivan Reitman. He occasionally makes cameos in films he shoots. He has directed several films, the best known being All the Right Moves (1983), starring Tom Cruise in one of that actor\u0027s breakthrough roles. His most recent film was Bridge to Terabithia. According to the DVD commentary, Chapman was planning to retire after the film was finished, saying he would have the last film he shot be a good one.Description above from the Wikipedia article Michael Chapman (cinematographer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, Stewart began photographing underwater when he was 13. By the age of 18 he became a scuba instructor and then moved on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology, studying in Ontario, Jamaica and Kenya.Before making Sharkwater (2007), Stewart spent four years travelling the world as chief photographer for the Canadian Wildlife Federation\u0027s magazines. Leading expeditions to the most remote areas of the world, Stewart has logged thousands of hours underwater using the latest in camera and rebreather technologies. Stewart\u0027s highly sought after images have appeared in nearly every media form worldwide.While on assignment to photograph sharks in the Galapagos Islands, Stewart discovered illegal longlining, indiscriminately killing sharks within the marine reserve. He tried promoting awareness through print media, but when the public didn\u0027t respond, Stewart decided to make a film to bring people closer to sharks. At the age of 22 he left his photography career behind and embarked on a remarkable journey over four years and 12 countries, resulting in the epic Sharkwater.When Stewart boarded Sea Shepherd\u0027s ship, Sharkwater took a turn from a beautiful underwater film into an incredible human drama filled with corruption, espionage, attempted murder charges and mafia rings, forcing Stewart and his crew to become part of the story. During filming, Stewart encountered life threatening obstacles, including diseases such as West Nile, Tuberculosis, Dengue Fever and flesh eating disease.Sharkwater has been hugely successful, premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival and winning a \"Canada\u0027s Top Ten\" award. Sharkwater made history with the largest opening weekend of any Canadian documentary, and was the most award-winning documentary of the year, winning over 35 awards at prestigious film festivals around the world. As of 2012 it is the third highest grossing Canadian documentary in the last ten years, next to the high budget films, Nascar and Oceans.Stewart\u0027s hardcover book, Sharkwater: An Odyssey to Save the Planet, was released in October 2007 by Key Porter Books. His book Save the Humans will be released in the Fall of 2012 by Random House.Stewart continues to work towards conservation and environmental education, speaking at the University of Victoria, Yale University, Vancouver Aquarium, ROM, various TEDx events, and others. Stewart is on the board of numerous conservation groups including WildAid, Shark Savers and the Shark Research Institute, and recently founded his own charity, United Conservationists, based in Los Angeles and Toronto. He has made featured appearances on numerous high profile TV shows including Larry King Live, The Today Show, Tonight Show, The Late Show, Nightline, Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight, ET Canada, Bloomberg, The Hour, BBC1, MTV and others.In a 2011 The Grid Magazine survey, he was voted top living resident for making Toronto a better place. Stewart is currently completing work on his second film, Revolution, due in theatres in 2013, with a companion rich digital media component, and How-to Guide to save humanity.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Ben Stassen is a Belgian film producer and director. He founded nWave Pictures in 1994, producing highly successful CGI ride films including the groundbreaking Devils Mine. Starting in 1997, Ben Stassen began focusing on large format films usually screened at IMAX theaters, and made some of the most successful large format films to date, including Thrill Ride: The Science of Fun and Alien Adventure. Contrary to most large format films, which mix education with spectacular visuals, most of Stassen\u0027s films are aimed exclusively at the entertainment market. As IMAX theaters around the world increasingly became capable of screening stereoscopic (3-D) films in the late nineties, Stassen quickly embraced this new technology, and directed a succession of popular 3-D large format films, such as Encounter in the Third Dimension and Haunted Castle. Upon screening \"Haunted Castle\", Imax corporation sent a fax to all the exhibitors warning them about the content of the film. Imax went as far as labeling \"Haunted Castle\" as degrading to the brand. This triggered a strong reaction from both the exhibitors and the press. The film was marketed as \"The film Imax corporation does not want you to see\". It went on the become a huge success worldwide.In 2004, Stassen produced and directed \"Wild Safari\", the first 3D wildlife film for the giant screen (Imax).nWave is also the leading producer and distributor of 3D ride films and 4D attraction films with over 30 titles in their library. Over 200,000 people a day see one of nWave\u0027s films in theme parks, science centers, zoo, aquaria and musea around the world.Ben Stassen\u0027s first feature length animated film, Fly Me to the Moon, was released in North America on 15 August 2008 on both regular size and IMAX screens, exclusively in 3-D. According to nWave, Fly Me to the Moon was the first animated film to be designed, created, and released solely in 3-D. The film was originally announced for the spring or summer of 2007. The delay is believed to be the result of the slow roll-out of 3-D projection technology.On 7 May 2008, nWave announced that its next feature length animated film would be titled Around the World in 50 Years and that it too would be directed by Ben Stassen. It was released in 2010 titled Sammy\u0027s Adventures: The Secret Passage.Stassen was also involved in the production of several movies directed by famed Croatian film director Krsto Papić, most notably \"My Uncle\u0027s Legacy\" (Život sa stricem), the film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Best Foreign Film category) in 1990.Stassen is widely quoted as a leading pioneer of 3D cinema, considering 3D as the 2nd revolution in the history of cinema, second only to the transition from silent film to the talkies. He mostly refers to American 3D film as 2.5 D cinema. In his opinion most filmmakers do not make any effort to use 3D as a new language of cinema. They simply shoot their 2D films with two cameras creating a little depth behind the screen with the odd in-your-face effect. He is also quite outspoken about the inadequacies of the 3D digital theaters. The essence of 3D cinema is its ability to greatly enhance the sense of immersion in the story being told. But there is no way to achieve real immersion unless you have floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall screens. The image must fill you field of vision as much as possible. The long term viability of 3D cinema will depend on the exhibitors willingness to build theaters designed specifically for 3D immersion.nWave Pictures is currently producing two 3D features. The sequel to Sammy\u0027s Adventures (\"Escape From Paradise\") and African Safari 3D, a live action 3D adventure documentary taking the audience from the cost of Skeleton Coast in Namibia to the top of the Kilimanjaro.Description above from the Wikipedia article Ben Stassen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia .",

He is also the director of the 1997 feature film Prefontaine. His newest film, The Interrupters, a portrayal of a year inside the lives of former gang members in Chicago who now intervene in violent conflicts, will be released in 2011 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is his sixth feature length collaboration with his long-time filmmaking home, the non-profit Chicago production studio Kartemquin Films, and is also his fifth feature to be accepted into the Sundance Film Festival.He is a graduate of Southern Illinois University Carbondale, studying with Charles Harpole. His work, he tells journalist Robert K. Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life, was strongly influenced by the film Harlan County, USA.There’ve been many documentaries over the years that have powerfully impacted me. I think this one came along at the time when I was more interested in being a feature filmmaker than a documentary filmmaker. So it came along at the beginning of a process of moving from an interest in feature film to documentaries, and that’s where my career has taken me. It came along at the right time for me. It helped me see, “Ah, this is more what I want to do.”Steve James also pulls influence from the original definition of the term cinema verite as it applies to the Rouch/Morin method of filmmaking. Just as with Rouch and Morin, the “people on camera and we in the audience are continually reminded that a film is being made, that we are watching a film.” We are reminded of this through James’ presence on screen as well as his cinematic editing techniques, in order to obtain, what he believes is a more accurate depiction of truth.Description above from the Wikipedia article Steve James (producer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia​",

Barmak received \"UNESCO’s Fellini Silver Medal\" for his drama, Osama, in 2003.Barmak is also director of the Afghan Children Education Movement (ACEM), an association that promotes literacy, culture and the arts, which was also founded by Makhmalbaf.

It ruined the pool.\"Marshall studied film directing at the AFI Conservatory where he directed his short film Waving Not Drowning. It later screened at the AFI/Los Angeles Film Festival.

He has directed the 2006 film Right at Your Door and is directing the upcoming film The Darkest Hour.Gorak attended Tulane University where he earned an architecture degree. He changed his career to film and worked as art director for directors like David Fincher, the Coen brothers, and Terry Gilliam. When Gorak worked as production designer on the 2004 film The Clearing, he expressed afterward to its producers an interest in film direction. They challenged him to provide something viable, and he wrote a script for an intended short film titled Right at Your Door. He eventually directed the 2006 feature thriller film Right at Your Door, which he said was reflective of authorities being impotent in a world after the September 11 attacks. He had initially worried about his film being too similar to 28 Days Later but found inspiration in filming on a low budget. After Right at Your Door, he planned to write and direct a cop drama titled SIS.[4] The film is not yet realized, and Gorak is currently directing the alien invasion film The Darkest Hour for release in 2011.Gorak is a member of the Art Directors Guild.Description above from the Wikipedia article Chris Gorak, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In between 1960 and 1964 he studied at Konstfack\u0027s department of graphic design.Åberg has produced some of the most successful films in Sweden, depicting \"typical\" Swedish life and customs in a usually humorous way. Åbergs character can be described as an inept outsider with a large heart, constantly pushed aside without noticing. One may say who he resembles the typical Chevy Chase or Mr. Bean character, likewise he shares the same tall and skinny physical characteristics.His films have generated over 300 million Swedish kronor (~43 million USD) in Sweden alone; no large scale international distribution has ever been attempted.As an artist, he is famous for making various lithographs; one of his stocks in trade are sketchy Mickey Mouse drawings. He is a member of Svenska Serieakademien. He also re-designed the seat textiles for the Stockholm Metro subway in the 1990s.As a musician, he played in the nationally successful band Electric Banana Band. Åberg is also the creator of Trazan och Banarne, one of the most beloved Swedish kids shows ever. It was shown on Swedish television in the late 70s/early 80s. The characters of the show, Trazan Apansson (Åberg) and Banarne (Klasse Möllberg) are also members of the Electric Banana Band.~Wikipedia.org",

It was produced and directed by Harvey for an estimated $33,000. Harvey had witnessed the recent success of Elmer Rhoden Jr. and fellow industrial filmmaker Robert Altman in producing low-budget feature films in nearby Kansas City, and began to secure backing from local investors in order to mount a similar project in Lawrence. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for Carnival of Souls after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiring an unknown New York actress, Lee Strasberg-trained Hilligoss, and otherwise employing mostly local talent, Harvey shot Carnival of Souls in three weeks, on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, using a script penned by Centron associate John Clifford. Harvey also played an uncredited role as the film\u0027s most prominent \"ghoul.\" Originally marketed as a B film and released by an upstart distribution company that quickly went bankrupt, Carnival of Souls never gained widespread public attention upon its original release but today has become hailed as a cult classic. Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, Carnival of Souls relies more on atmosphere than on special effects to create its mood of psychological horror. The film has a large cult following, built up primarily via late-night television screenings, and has been released on DVD by the Criterion Collection (complete with a host of special features, including an hour of excerpts from Harvey\u0027s Centron productions). To this day, the movie is still discussed by film buffs and occasionally has screenings at Halloween and art film festivals.Description above from the Wikipedia article Herk Harvey, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "birthPlace": "Hilary Mary Allcroft Worthing, England",
        "gender": "Not Specified",
        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Britt Allcroft is the multi- award-winning creator of a trio of children\u0027s entertainment produced in the 1980s and 1990s: \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\", (now retitled \"Thomas and Friends\"), \"Shining Time Station\" (with co-creator Rick Siggelkow) and \"Britt Allcroft\u0027s Magic Adventures of Mumfie\".She was born Hilary Mary Allcroft, in Worthing, England and, at 16, changed her name to Britt as her career in British radio and TV gained momentum. She went on to create a string of shows for the BBC and ITV networks, including \"Moon Clue Game\", \"Get it, Got it, Good\", \"Dance Crazy\", \"Keepsakes\" and \"Mothers by Daughters\" . She worked in live theatre staging shows at the London Palladium and Drury Lane Theatres.In 1979, Allcroft was making a five-minute film for the Central Office of Information about the resurgence of interest in steam railways. One inspiration for the film was A Guide to the Steam Railways of Britain, a book compiled by the Rev. W. Awdry and Dr Christopher Cook, and published by Eric Marriott, the former editor of The Railway Series. As Awdry would be taking part in the programme, Allcroft was prompted to read some of the volumes of the Railway Series, for the first time. She said: \"it really didn\u0027t take me long to become intrigued by the characters and the relationships between them and the simplicity of the stories. I was equally intrigued by the illustrations, the landscape in them and the nostalgia they invoked.\" She met Awdry, saying she wanted to make a TV series, based on his stories. Although Awdry was initially reluctant, a deal was eventually done It took Britt three years to raise the finance and find all the people who could make her dream come true. The first episode of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, was aired in the UK in September 1984.In 1984 she co-founded the Britt Allcroft Company with her then husband, Angus Wright, formulating cover of all merchandising and television rights in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. The company went public in 1996 and was renamed Gullane Entertainment.Once Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends had become a critical and commercial success in the UK, Allcroft and her production company looked to promote the brand in North America. As the Thomas films were only 5 minutes long, initially, the company found it difficult in placing the series in the USA, as generally, the networks preferred 30 minute formats and so in 1988 the Britt Allcroft Company teamed up with PBS Station WNET in New York to produce and distribute Shining Time Station, where every episode of the show would include a couple episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.She wrote and directed the movie \"Thomas and the Magic Railroad\", released in 2000, as well as providing the voice for the character Lady. The film was not a critical success, and Allcroft resigned in September 2000. Her resignation followed many years of internal stress within the company. In 2007, news surfaced on a Thomas fan site that the released version of the Thomas movie was a drastically edited version of Allcroft\u0027s original script and shot film - in effect, the claim was that production of the film had been taken out of her hands.Gullane was subsequently acquired in 2003 by Hit Entertainment, which was taken over by Apax Partners in 2005.Wright and Allcroft are divorced.Britt Allcroft is now living and working in Santa Monica, California. She re-acquired Mumfie from HiT Entertainment in 2008. She is on the advisory council of Southern California Public Radio and the Audrey Hepburn Children\u0027s Fund.Description above from the Wikipedia article Britt Allcroft, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After some time working in advertising, he got a job in a psychiatric institution where he began experimenting in animation with the interns. It is at the psychiatric institution that he made 1960\u0027s Monkey\u0027s Teeth (Les Dents du Singe), in collaboration with Paul Grimault\u0027s studio, and using a script written by the Cour Cheverny\u0027s interns. Another important collaborator of his was Roland Topor with whom Laloux made Dead Time (Les Temps Morts, 1964), The Snails (Les Escargots, 1965) and his most famous work, the feature length Fantastic Planet (La Planète Sauvage, 1973). Laloux also worked with Jean Giraud (Mœbius) to create the lesser known film Les Maîtres du temps (Time Masters), released in 1982. Laloux\u0027s 1988 film, Gandahar, was released in the US as Light Years, and made in cooperation with the artist Caza. The US version was redubbed by Harvey Weinstein, from a screenplay adapted by Isaac Asimov. The US version was not as successful as the French version, grossing less than $400,000 on its release. Laloux died of a heart attack on March 14, 2004 in Angoulême, Charente, Poitou-Charentes, France.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Hiroshi Teshigahara (January 28, 1927 – April 14, 2001) was an avant-garde Japanese filmmaker.He was born in Tokyo, son of Sofu Teshigahara, founder and grand master of the Sogetsu School of ikebana. He graduated in 1950 from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and began working in documentary film. He directed his first feature film, Pitfall (1962), in collaboration with author Kōbō Abe and musician Tōru Takemitsu. The film won the NHK New Director\u0027s award, and throughout the 1960s, he continued to collaborate on films with Abe and Takemitsu while simultaneously pursuing his interest in ikebana and sculpture on a professional level.In 1965, the Teshigahara/Abe film Woman in the Dunes (1964) was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1972, he worked with Japanese researcher and translator John Nathan to make the movie Summer Soldiers, a film set during the Vietnam War about American deserters living on the fringe of Japanese society.From the mid-1970s onwards, he worked less frequently on feature films as he concentrated more on documentaries, exhibitions and the Sogetsu School and became grand master of the school in 1980.In 1978, Teshigahara Hiroshi directed the final two episodes of the long running and popular Japanese television series Shin Zatouichi, starring Shintarō Katsu as the blind wandering Yakuza. During Akira Kurosawa\u0027s 5 year hiatus from filmmaking, he watched a lot of television and was particularly taken by the final episode of Shin Zatouichi - Episode: Journey of Dreams (1978). The influence of this particular episode included the initial casting of Shintaro Katsu in the lead roles in Kagemusha and the extended artistic dream sequences contributed to those seen in Kagemusha (1980).On the first anniversary of his death, April 14, 2002, a DVD box set containing his best known work was released in Japan in commemoration.Description above from the Wikipedia article Hiroshi Teshigahara, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

While a teenager, he moved to the United States and directed a series of short films and documentaries. Universal Studios hired Hessler as a story reader for the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series. He became story editor for two seasons (1960–1962) for that series, then served as the associate producer for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour from 1962 until its cancellation in 1965. He directed episodes of that series and several other shows (including Hawaii Five-O).In 1969, he directed his debut feature film, The Oblong Box, starring Vincent Price. It was the first of three horror films Hessler would direct with the veteran horror star, the other two being Cry of the Banshee (1970) and Scream and Scream Again (1970). Hessler\u0027s other films include Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974) and The Girl in a Swing (1988) starring Meg Tilly, an adaptation of Richard Adams\u0027s ghost story novel.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Alan Clarke (28 October 1935 – 24 July 1990) was a television and film director, producer and writer, born in Wallasey, Merseyside, England.Most of Clarke\u0027s output was for television rather than cinema, including work for the famous play strands The Wednesday Play and Play for Today. His subject matter tended towards social realism, especially with respect to deprived or oppressed communities.As Dave Rolinson\u0027s book (see \u0027Further reading\u0027, below) on Clarke details, between 1962 and 1966 Clarke directed several plays at The Questors Theatre in Ealing, London. Between 1967 and 1969 he directed various ITV productions including plays by Alun Owen (Shelter, George’s Room, Stella, Thief, Gareth), Edna O’Brien (Which Of These Two Ladies Is He Married To? and Nothing’s Ever Over) and Roy Minton (The Gentleman Caller, Goodnight Albert, Stand By Your Screen). He also worked on the series The Informer, The Gold Robbers and A Man Of Our Times (but not, as Sight and Sound once claimed, Big Breadwinner Hog). Clarke continued to work for ITV through the 1970s but now made much of his work for the BBC. This included pieces for The Wednesday Play (Sovereign\u0027s Company 1970), Play for Today and Play of the Month. Distinctive work for these strands included further plays by Minton including Funny Farm (1975) and Scum (further details below), but also Sovereign’s Company (1970) by Don Shaw, The Hallelujah Handshake (1970) by Colin Welland and Penda’s Fen (1974) by David Rudkin. He also made To Encourage the Others (1972), a powerful drama documentary about the Derek Bentley case, and several documentaries, including Vodka Cola (1981) on multinational corporations.A number of his works achieved notoriety and widespread criticism from the conservative end of the political spectrum, including Scum (1977), dealing with the subject of borstals (youth prisons), which was banned by the BBC, and subsequently remade by Clarke as a feature film in 1979 (the original television version was eventually screened after his death). His 1982 television play Made in Britain, starring Tim Roth (in his television debut) as a racist skinhead and his negative relationship with authorities and racial minorities, was based on a screenplay by David Leland. He directed the feature film Rita, Sue and Bob Too released in 1987.Clarke\u0027s work in the 1980s is fiercely stark and political, including the David Leland plays Beloved Enemy (1981) on multinational corporations and Psy-Warriors (1981) on military interrogation. But he also directed David Bowie in Baal (1982) for the BBC, part of Clarke’s interest in Bertolt Brecht. His film work became more sparse, culminating in Contact (1984) on the British military presence in Northern Ireland, Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire (1985), Road (1987) and his short film (40 mins.) Elephant (1989) which dealt with \u0027the troubles\u0027 in Northern Ireland and featured a series of shootings with no narrative and hardly any dialogue; all were based on accounts of actual sectarian killings that had taken place in Belfast. The film took its title from Bernard MacLaverty\u0027s description of the troubles as \"the elephant in our living room\" - a reference to the collective denial of the underlying social problems of Northern Ireland. His final production, The Firm (1989), covered football hooliganism through the lead character played by Gary Oldman, but also the politics of Thatcher’s Britain.Clarke inspired a generation of actors, writers and directors, including Paul Greengrass, Stephen Frears, Tim Roth, Ray Winstone, Gary Oldman, Danny Brocklehurst and Iain MacDonald. Filmmaker Harmony Korine has cited Clarke as a major influence on his work.Clarke\u0027s son is Gabriel Clarke, an award-winning sports journalist with ITV.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alan Clarke, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

        "biography": "Brian Trenchard-Smith is an Anglo Australian film and television director, producer, and writer, with a reputation for large scale movies on small scale budgets, many of which display a quirky sense of humor that has earned him a cult following. Quentin Tarantino referred to him in Entertainment Weekly as one of his favorite directors. His early work is featured in Not Quite Hollywood, an award winning documentary released by Magnolia. Among his early successes were the 20th Century Fox release The Man from Hong Kong, a wry James Bond/Chop Sockey cocktail, the Vietnam battle movie Siege of Firebase Gloria, and the futuristic satire Dead End Drive-In, a particular Tarantino favorite. BMX Bandits, showcasing a 15-year old Nicole Kidman, and Miramax\u0027s The Quest, starring ET\u0027s Henry Thomas, won prizes at children\u0027s film festivals in Montreal and Europe. He has also directed 35 episodes of television series as diverse as Silk Stalkings, Time Trax, The Others, and Flipper. Born in England, where his Australian father was in the RAF, Trenchard-Smith attended UK\u0027s prestigious Wellington College, where he neglected studies in favor of acting and making short films, before migrating to Australia. He started as a news film editor, then graduated to network promos before he became one of a group of young people that, as he recalls, \"pushed, shoved, lobbied and bullied the government into introducing investment for Australian made films.\" He persuaded Australia\u0027s largest distribution-exhibition circuit at the time, the Greater Union Theater Organization, to form an in-house production company that he would run. The company made three successful films in a row, and his career was underway. In parallel careers, he was also founding editor of Australia\u0027s quarterly Movie magazine for 6 years, and has made over 100 trailers for other directors in Australia, Europe, and America. Among his 39 movies, 5 were commissioned by Showtime, including the remake of the World War II classic, Sahara, the highly rated, Happy Face Murders, starring Ann-Margret, and DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, with Timothy Bottoms as President Bush. His frequently repeated family drama for Lifetime, Long Lost Son starring Gabrielle Anwar, introduced future Gossip Girl\u0027s Chace Crawford to audiences in the title role.\" I knew from his first scene, he was going to be hot.\" In 2009, Trenchard-Smith shot Porky\u0027s - The College Years, a re-imagining of the famous 80\u0027s franchise of teen comedies. His recent ecological thriller Arctic Blast, starring Michael Shanks, was chosen to premiere at the 2010 Possible Worlds Canadian Film Festival in Sydney. Trenchard-Smith writes for filmindustrybloggers.com as The Genre Director, and is a contributing guru to trailersfromhell.com. He is married to Byzantine historian Dr. Margaret Trenchard-Smith, lives in Los Angeles, and is a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.",

Gimbel (February 14, 1927 - July 12, 1987) was an American filmmaker and underwater photojournalist.Born in New York City, Peter was the son of Bernard Gimbel and heir to the Gimbels department store chain.  After serving in the United States Army occupation force in Japan in 1946-1947, he graduated from Yale University in 1951, earning degrees in both English and economics.  He spent ten years as an investment banker but after the death of his twin brother at age 29, he left banking to pursue a career in exploration. He parachuted into the Peruvian Andes with G. Brooks Baekeland, grandson of Leo Baekeland, inventor of Baekelite, and Peter Lake in search of the lost Inca city of Vilcabamba.He was the first to dive the wreck of the SS Andrea Doria and his photos of the ship were published in Life Magazine in August 1956.  He produced two documentaries about the ship The Mystery of the Andrea Doria and Andrea Doria: The Final Chapter.  He opened the safe of the Andrea Doria on live television in 1984.Gimbel also directed and produced the 1971 film Blue Water, White Death which was the first cinematic filming of the Great White Shark, featuring Ron and Valerie Taylor, Rodney Fox, Stan Waterman and Peter Lake.  The shark\u0027s attack on Lake\u0027s cage at the end of the film inspired Peter Benchley\u0027s book, Jaws.Description above from the Wikipedia article Peter Gimbel, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After a number of film production jobs and assistant directing, Werker co-directed his first film, Ridin\u0027 the Wind in 1925 alongside director Del Andrews. He was brought in by Fox Film Corporation executives to re-shoot and re-edit Erich von Stroheim\u0027s film Hello, Sister! (1933), co-starring Boots Mallory and ZaSu Pitts. Most of Werker\u0027s work is unremarkable, but a few were well received by critics. Those films included House of Rothschild (1934) and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939); the latter film is considered one of the best in the Sherlock Holmes series. During the early 1940s, he directed a number of comedies including Laurel \u0026amp; Hardy\u0027s A-Haunting We Will Go (1942). In the late 1940s, Werker worked for the B-picture film studio Eagle-Lion Films. Notable films from that period include the unique mystery thriller Repeat Performance and He Walked by Night. The latter film, however, was taken over by uncredited director Anthony Mann. Werker was nominated in 1949 for the Locarno International Film Festival\u0027s Best Police Film category for He Walked By Night (1948) and won. The following year, Alfred was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for Lost Boundaries (1949) but was unsuccessful.Description above from the Wikipedia article Alfred L.

Germi was born in Genoa, Liguria, to a lower-middle class family. He was a messenger and briefly attended nautical school before deciding on a career in acting.He studied acting and directing at Rome\u0027s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. During his time in school, Germi supported himself by working as an extra, bit actor, assistant director, and, on occasion, writer. Germi made his directorial debut in 1945 with the film Il testimone. His early work, this film included, were very much in the Italian Neorealist style; many were social dramas that dealt with contemporary issues pertaining to people of Sicilian heritage.Through the years, Germi shifted away from social drama towards satirical comedies, but retained his loved element of the Sicilian people. In the 1960s, Germi received worldwide success with the films Divorce, Italian Style, Seduced and Abandoned, and Signore e Signori. The latter is better known in the English-speaking world as The Birds the Bees and the Italians. He was nominated for Academy Awards in both directing and writing for Divorce, Italian Style, and, subsequently, won in the writing category. He also won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for Signore e signori.Germi collaborated on the scripts for all the films he directed and appeared as an actor in a few of them. He died in Rome of hepatitis on 5 December 1974.",

He appeared in an episode of the classic BBC sitcom Steptoe and Son when he was fifteen, but his first major role was at the age of sixteen, in the Thames Television series You Must Be Joking! , which he also co-created and wrote. He also starred with Phil Daniels in Four Idle Hands, at the time having two hit networked television shows running alternately in the same hour.In 1978 Burdis auditioned for a presenting job on the BBC children\u0027s programme Blue Peter as a replacement for John Noakes. Richard Marson\u0027s book celebrating the show\u0027s fiftieth anniversary records this fact and film of the audition was shown at a BAFTA celebration in October 2008.Burdis came to real prominence when he took the part of cowardly inmate Eckersley in the controversial movie Scum in 1979. He had played the same role two years earlier in a BBC television version of the story, although this was not transmitted for many years due to its graphic nature, hence the cinematic re-make. He later had a small role alongside Daniel Day-Lewis in the film Gandhi (1982).Burdis then played a supporting role as Richard, a gay neighbour in Channel 4\u0027s short-lived sitcom \"Dream Stuffing\" in 1984. After this, he played ambitious photographer Nick Tyler in the BBC comedy Three Up, Two Down. His character was the son and son-in-law respectively of the two lead characters, played by Michael Elphick and Angela Thorne. The series rated over 17million viewers and went on for 5 seasons.In addition to acting, Burdis also co-founded Fugitive - an independent film, television and music production company which started life as a premier music video producer, producing videos for internationally renowned artists such as Elton John, Queen, Tina Turner and George Michael, placing itself in the Top 5 international music video production companies. Burdis also produced The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for television, the largest ever live outside broadcast at the time, it was transmitted in every country around the world to an audience 40% larger than Live Aid. Burdis’ first foray into television drama was creating the series The Fear, for Euston Films, which was broadcast on the ITV Network. The series was critically acclaimed and was based on the unpublicised real-life gangster scene of the late 1980s.Burdis has subsequently concentrated more on writing, producing and directing. He was the producer of The Krays, the critically acclaimed biopic of the East End gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray written by Philip Ridley, and also co-wrote-produced and directed the movies Final Cut and Love, Honour and Obey starring such actors as Jude Law, Jonny Lee Miller, Kathy Burke, Ray Winstone, Rhys Ifans. He also created, co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the television police fly on the wall docu-comedy Operation Good Guys for three series. The series was awarded the Silver Rose for Best Sitcom and the Prix de la Presse, voted for by the International Press, at the Montreux Golden Rose Festival.Turning his hand once again to acting he went on to co-star in the BBC Two comedy drama series Manchild for two series, along with Nigel Havers, Anthony Head and Don Warrington.Having launched a new film production company Britflick Productions in 2010, Ray Burdis is shooting the controversial film, \u0027The Wee Man\u0027 which is scheduled for production in the late summer 2011 in association with Carnaby films.Ray also had an interesting Music background in his teens: Great British Heroes had their roots in Stars \u0026amp; Stripes, a North London band formed early in 1976 by Ray Burdis (vocals), Graham Reed (gtr), Vince (b) and Rowland Rivron (d). In mid-’76 Rivron quit (later to be a TV celebrity). In the autumn the group entered Strawberry Studios in London to record a single for Lightning Records. At Christmas Great British Heroes hired a manager, Jeff Miller, whose lawyer promptly declared the proposed Lightning contract “not a good idea”: the single was shelved, and in November 1978. Great British Heroes (or GBH, as they were sometimes advertised) played all the usual London venues including The Rock Garden, Upstairs at Ronnie Scott’s, the Nashville and even the Roxy, as well as touring Denmark. Eventually, in late 1979 Ray Burdis quit to concentrate on film work (as both an actor and director he would become a central figure in British TV and cinema)Description above from the Wikipedia article Ray Burdis, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Hickox was born in London, where he was educated at Emanuel School. Hickox worked extensively as an assistant director and second unit director throughout the 50\u0027s and early 60\u0027s, making his first major picture in 1970. Over the next ten years, he developed a reputation for the wit and style of his direction, and for his taut action sequences. His work includes Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (1968), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1969), Theatre of Blood (1973) and Zulu Dawn (1979).Hickox was married to Anne V. Coates, the Oscar winning editor of Lawrence of Arabia. After his death in 1988, his second wife Annabel approached the BIFA (British Independent Film Awards) with an annual bequest from Douglas\u0027 estate. This bequest led directly to the creation of the British Independent Film Awards. In recognition of Douglas\u0027s commitment and support for new talent, BIFA inaugurated the Douglas Hickox Award, which is given to a British director on their debut feature.Douglas Hickox\u0027s sons, Anthony Hickox and James D.R. Hickox are also film directors and one of his daughters, Emma, a film editor. Anthony Hickox\u0027s best known work is perhaps Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992), whilst he was Executive Producer on Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995) directed by James D.R. Hickox. Emma E. Hickox\u0027s career has probably taken her the furthest though with films like The Jacket, Kinky Boots, Blood and Chocolate, Blue Crush, Becoming Jane and A Walk to Remember on her CV.Description above from the Wikipedia article Douglas Hickox, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Režisér, scénárista a herec Juraj Herz se narodil 4. září 1934 ve slovenském Kežmarku. Ke konci války byl spolu s rodiči deportován do koncentračního tábora. Po válce studoval na bratislavské Střední uměleckoprůmyslové škole fotografii a po ní na loutkářské fakultě DAMU režii a herectví. Poté spolupracoval jako režisér a herec s divadlem Semafor. Do menších úloh byl obsazován i ve filmech a brzy začal pracovat na Barrandově také jako asistent režie a pomocný režisér, mimo jiné na filmu Obchod na korze režisérské dvojice Ján Kadár - Elmar Klos. Jako samostatný režisér debutoval roku 1965 středometrážním snímkem Sběrné surovosti podle povídky Bohumila Hrabala. V následujících letech bylo zřejmé, že do naší kinematografie vstoupil talentovaný originální tvůrce, který se se stejnou jistotou a elegancí pohybuje na poli psychologického dramatu (Znamení Raka, Petrolejové lampy), komedie (Kulhavý ďábel, Holky z porcelánu), tragické grotesky (Spalovač mrtvol), hororu (Upír z Feratu), stylizovaného romantického příběhu (Morgiana) a v neposlední řadě i působivé pohádky s tajemnou atmosférou (Panna a netvor, Deváté srdce, Přezůvky štěstí). Jeho filmy se vedle žánrové různorodosti vždy vyznačovaly smyslem pro budování napětí, ale také smyslem pro humor (často černý), mimořádná pozornost byla věnována výtvarně stylizované stránce obrazu i promyšlenému výběru a vedení herců.Juraj Herz ve své znamenité a úspěšné sérii filmů pokračoval také po roce 1987, kdy emigroval do NSR. Dále natáčel klasické i moderní filmové pohádky (Žabí princ, Hloupá Augustina, Císařovy nové šaty), více se věnoval tvorbě dokumentárních TV filmů i seriálů pro různé televizní společnosti v Německu, Rakousku, Francii i USA. Od začátku devadesátých let střídavě točí v České republice a v zahraničí filmy i dokumenty, inscenace a seriály, působí jako divadelní režisér v činohře i v opeře. Za vlastní filmovou tvorbu získal řadu domácích i mezinárodních ocenění, včetně velkých cen na festivalech v Karlových Varech, v Monte Carlu, v Chicagu aj. Vedle toho byl vyznamenán Velkou cenou bavorské televize a Státní cenou Bavorska.Zdroj: katalog 44. MFF pro děti a mládež Zlín 2004",

Anno is best known for his work on the popular anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. His style has come to be defined by the touches of superflatism and postmodernism that he injects into his work, as well as the thorough portrayal of characters\u0027 thoughts and emotions, often through unconventional sequences incorporating psychoanalysis and emotional deconstruction of these characters. He married comics artist Moyoco Anno in 27 April 2002. Anime directed by Anno that have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award have been Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water in 1990, Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995 and 1996, and The End of Evangelion in 1997.Description above from the Wikipedia article Hideaki Anno, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

She is known for her deeply personal films that explore issues such as gender, race, and diaspora. Much of her work explores Korean culture in an explicitly self-reflexive and emotive way.Kim\u0027s first noted documentary was Gina Kim\u0027s Video Diary, begun in 1995 when she had recently arrived in Los Angeles, and completed in 2002. Invisible Light (2003) is about a woman married to a man named Jun and another involved in an affair with him.[1] Kim\u0027s fictional film, Never Forever (2007), featured a well-reviewed starring performance by actress Vera Farmiga and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Her documentary, Faces of Seoul (2009), \"reveals Korea\u0027s capital as a dynamic place where these opposing concepts--language vs. image, tradition vs. modern, native knowledge vs. exotic encounter--rub against each other without yielding a single dominant perspective.\"Kim studied at CalArts and was a full-time lecturer at Harvard University\u0027s Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (housed in the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts) between 2004 and 2007.Description above from the Wikipedia article Gina Kim, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His graduation film Scratch, made in 1991, went on to win numerous awards at short film festivals around the world. He made another award winning film under the BFI New Directors scheme, The Take-Out (1993). He then joined the Royal College Of Art, where he made another award winning film, The Hackney Downs (1994). After leaving the RCA he joined Oil Factory, a leading music video company. There he made his groundbreaking video for Radiohead for their song Just, where a man lies on the pavement and is confronted by an angry crowd. The video used subtitles as in a foreign movie and has perplexed and infuriated fans for years. Thraves made one more short film, his most successful to date - I Just Want To Kiss You (1997), starring Martin Freeman predating his role as Tim in Ricky Gervais\u0027s The Office, won the Fox Searchlight Award for Best Short Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1998.Thraves made his first feature, The Low Down (2000), with Film 4. It starred Aidan Gillen, Kate Ashfield and Dean Lennox Kelly. The film was named among the \"neglected masterpieces\" of film history by The Observer in its rundown of 50 Lost Movie Classics.[citation needed] Thraves has continued to make music videos for such artists as The Verve, Blur and Coldplay. His video for Coldplay\u0027s The Scientist won three Moon Men at the 2003 VMA\u0027S in the US, including Best Direction and Breakthrough Video.His second feature, The Cry of The Owl (2009), with BBC Films starred Paddy Considine and Julia Stiles. It was based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith.His third feature film, Treacle Jr. (2010), reunited him with Aidan Gillen. At the film\u0027s world premiere at the 21st Dinard British Film Festival it won the Hitchcock D\u0027Or - Grand Jury Prize. Thraves reportedly remortgaged his house to make the film. Treacle Jr. had its UK Premiere at the 54th BFI London Film Festival. Time Out said of Treacle Jr.: \"Funny, touching and gritty, this coolly rendered observation on need and rejection really is a Brit drama to shout about\".  Description above from the Wikipedia article Jamie Thraves, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia. ",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Robert Kenner is an American film and television screenwriter, television director, film director, film producer, and television producer.His career began in 1971 as an assistant cinematographer, and produced his first motion picture, 3:15 - The Moment of Truth, in 1984 (although it was not released until 1986). His second feature film did not come until 1991\u0027s Lonely Hearts.His first breakout project was the televised documentary The Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal, which he produced for the National Geographic Society and which aired in 1993 on PBS. The following year, he directed and produced Russia\u0027s Last Tsar for National Geographic and PBS. He also directed and produced America\u0027s Endangered Species: Don\u0027t Say Good-bye in 1996. The International Documentary Association presented the picture with the Strand Award for Best Documentary.Kenner began a long association with the award-winning PBS documentary television program American Experience in 1998. That year he directed and produced the widely reviewed Influenza, 1918 (about the 1918 flu pandemic)and followed it up with John Brown\u0027s Holy War (about abolitionist John Brown) in 2001. His first documentary which he wrote, directed and produced was War Letters, which aired on American Experience in 2001. The documentary is based on the 2001 New York Times best-selling book War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars by historian Andrew Carroll. He produced the episode, \"The Road to Memphis,\" for the 2003 PBS documentary series, The Blues, and in 2005 produced and directed the Vietnam War documentary, Two Days in October. The documentary was the season premiere of American Experience. The film, which is based on David Maraniss\u0027 book They Marched into Sunlight, looks at the parallels between a Viet Cong ambush of a U.S. Army patrol (and the subsequent cover-up of the loss by the American military) and a violent clash between police and student protesters at the University of Wisconsin–Madison—events which occurred 24 hours apart in October 1967. The episode was nominated for and won the award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking at the 2006 Emmy Awards.In 2008, Kenner produced and directed the documentary film, Food, Inc., which examines large-scale agricultural food production in the United States, concluding that the meat and vegetables produced by this type of economic enterprise leads to inexpensive but environmentally harmful and unhealthy food.Description above from the Wikipedia article Robert Kenner, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",

        "biography": "​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.Joseph H. Lewis  (April 6, 1907–August 30, 2000), was an American B-movie film director.Although he worked with both Béla Lugosi (The Invisible Ghost) and Lionel Atwill in early 1940s horror, he is best known for his work in film noir from the late 40s and the 1950s. His most acclaimed feature, Gun Crazy (1949), is a dark romance about gun-obsession, and notable for its use of location photography.At the dawn of his career (1937–1940), when Lewis was directing inexpensive westerns, he earned the derogatory nickname \"Wagon-Wheel Joe\" from the studio editors, because of his tendency to use wagon-wheels for constructing interesting visual compositions within the frame.Lewis\u0027s offbeat and eye-catching compositions added style and value to inexpensive productions. His 1944 musical Minstrel Man, starring singer Benny Fields, is quite possibly the finest film ever made by low-budget PRC Pictures. Industry insiders noticed, prompting Columbia Pictures to hire Lewis to film the musical sequences for its blockbuster musical The Jolson Story.Toward the end of Lewis\u0027s career, he worked in television, directing mostly westerns: The Rifleman, Bonanza, The Big Valley, Gunsmoke, and the pilot for Branded.Description above from the Wikipedia article Joseph H.

He tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work and later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman / Ring Lardner play June Moon in 1929. He has also acted in London, England.He started working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts. His film acting credits include Prosperity (1932), Pilgrimage (1933), Rafter Romance (1933) with Ginger Rogers and State Fair (1933). He has written several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs.Some of Foster\u0027s directorial efforts include The Sign of Zorro (1958), and the stylish films noir Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948), Woman on the Run (1950) and Journey into Fear (1943). Foster directed Rachel and the Stranger and the Davy Crockett segments of Disneyland that were edited into feature films Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates where he did not accept any interference from Walt Disney.In 1967, he directed Brighty of the Grand Canyon, based on a children\u0027s novel by Marguerite Henry about a burro in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The film starred Joseph Cotten, Karl Swenson, Dick Foran, and Pat Conway.It was rumored that Orson Welles took over direction of Journey Into Fear, which Welles later denied. Foster was the director of the \"My Friend Bonito\" segment of Orson Welles\u0027 Pan-American anthology film It\u0027s All True until RKO aborted the project.Foster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including Charlie Chan in Panama (1940), Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939), Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Charlie Chan in Reno (1939), Mr. Moto\u0027s Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938), Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938), Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937), and Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937).Foster was married to Claudette Colbert from 1928 until their divorce in 1935.

They had two children, Robert and Gretchen.He is buried in Culver City\u0027s Holy Cross Cemetery.Description above from the Wikipedia article Norman Foster, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He then made films for the Rockefeller Foundation and other academic institutions, later becoming a film editor and second-unit director involved with the emerging American documentary movement of the late \u002730s. Lerner produced two documentaries for the Office of War Information during WW II and after the war became the head of New York University\u0027s Educational Film Institute. In 1948, Lerner and Joseph Strick shared directorial chores on a short documentary, Muscle Beach. Lerner then turned to low-budget, quickly filmed features. When not hastily making his own thrillers, Lerner worked as a technical advisor, a second-unit director, a co-editor and an editor.Lerner was cinematographer, director, or assistant director on documentary films such as One Third of a Nation (1939), Valley Town (1940), The Land (1942) directed by Robert Flaherty, and Suicide Attack (1950). Lerner was also producer of the OWI documentary Hymn of the Nations (1944), directed by Alexander Hammid, and featuring Arturo Toscanini, and co-director with Joseph Strick of the short documentary Muscle Beach (1948).Irving Lerner was also an important director and film editor with directing credits such as Studs Lonigan (1960) and editing credits such as Stanley Kubrick\u0027s Spartacus (1960) and Martin Scorsese\u0027s New York, New York (1977). Lerner died during the cutting of New York, New York, and the film was dedicated to him.The \"Blacklist\": Irving Lerner was an American citizen and an employee of the United States Office of War Information during World War II who worked in the Motion Picture Division. Lerner was allegedly involved in espionage on behalf of Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU); Arthur Adams was Lerner\u0027s key contact.In the winter of 1944, a counterintelligence officer caught Lerner attempting to photograph the cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which was part of the Manhattan Project. The cyclotron had been used in the creation of plutonium and Lerner was acting without authorization. Lerner resigned and went to work for Keynote Recordings, owned by Eric Bernay, another Soviet intelligence contact.

Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1924 to 1956—a 32-year career.Gibbons was one of the original 36 founding members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and oversaw the design of the Academy Awards statuette in 1928, a trophy for which he himself would be nominated 39 times, winning 11.He retired in 1956 with about 1,500 films credited to him: however, his contract with MGM dictated that he receive credit as art director for every MGM film released in the United States, even though other designers may have done the bulk of the work. Even so, his actual hands-on art direction may have been on about 150 films.In 1930, Gibbons married actress Dolores del Río and co-designed their house in Santa Monica, an intricate Art Deco residence influenced by Rudolf Schindler. They divorced in 1941; three years later he married actress Hazel Brooks with whom he remained until his death at the age of 67.Gibbons\u0027s grave is in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.",

Levin was awarded the 1997 DuPont-Columbia Award for CIA: America\u0027s Secret Warriors, a three-part series that first aired on the Discovery Channel. He is also the recipient of a 1999 primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special. In 1996, his Prisoners of the War on Drugs was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Informational Special. He was also nominated for an Emmy, in 2010, for his role as producer of the documentary series Brick City.Levin\u0027s documentary The Protocols of Zion, which is about resurgent anti-Semitism following the September 11, 2001 attacks, focuses on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-Semitic forgery which supposedly describes the Jewish plan for global domination. Although the book has been repeatedly debunked as an obvious forgery, Levin continually discovers various groups presenting it as \"proof\" for their own anti-Semitic agenda.He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1973.Description above from the Wikipedia article Marc Levin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was born in Đà Nẵng, Central Vietnam, and emigrated to France when he was 12 following the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Trần has long been considered as having been in the forefront of the wave of acclaimed overseas Vietnamese cinema in the past two decades. His films have received international notoriety and acclaim, and until recently had all been varied meditations on life in Vietnam. His Oscar-nominated debut (for Best foreign film) was with The Scent of Green Papaya (1993) which also won two top prizes at the prestigious Cannes film festival, and his followup Cyclo (1995) featured top Hong Kong movie star Tony Leung Chiu Wai, also eventually winning a top prize at the Venice International Film Festival. The Vertical Ray of the Sun, released in 2000, was the third film in what many consider now to be his \"Vietnam trilogy.\" After a sabbatical, it was officially announced that Trần is back behind the helm with the noir psychological thriller I Come with the Rain (2009), which features a star-studded international cast including Josh Hartnett and Elias Koteas. It was announced in July 2008 that Trần would direct an adaptation of Haruki Murakami\u0027s novel Norwegian Wood. The film was released in Japan in December of 2010. Trần\u0027s wife, actress Trần Nữ Yên Khê, has starred in every single one of his films to date, with the exception of Norwegian Wood.Description above from the Wikipedia article Tran Anh Hung licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Born in Glasgow, he studied at Oxford University and left graduate work on a PhD about John Milton to pursue a career in comedy.Rising quickly through BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, his early work with Chris Morris on the radio series On the Hour was transferred to television as The Day Today. A character from this series, Alan Partridge, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci\u0027s television and radio programmes including Knowing Me, Knowing You and I\u0027m Alan Partridge. In the meantime, Iannucci also fronted the satirical Armistice review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, The Armando Iannucci Shows for Channel 4.Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom The Thick of It as well as the spoof documentary Time Trumpet in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film In the Loop featuring characters from The Thick of It in 2009. As a result of these works, he has been being described by The Daily Telegraph as \"the hardman of political satire\".[2] Other works during this period include a operetta libretto, Skin Deep and his radio series Charm Offensive. He is currently working on a U.S. political satire for HBO called Veep.Description above from the Wikipedia article Armando Iannucci, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is best known for co-creating the Comedy Central series Chappelle\u0027s Show.Brennan and Dave Chappelle met when both were aspiring stand-ups. Through his older brother, an established stand up comedian and comedy writer Kevin Brennan, Brennan got a part-time job working as the doorman at Boston Comedy Club in New York City where Chappelle was a frequent performer. They became good friends and collaborated on jokes. They co-wrote the film Half-Baked which starred Chappelle. In an interview on Inside the Actor\u0027s Studio, Chappelle admitted that he and Brennan could not help but see each other as a painful reminder of the box-office failure of Half-Baked and lost touch with each other. Four years later, they rekindled their partnership to create the sketch comedy show, Chappelle\u0027s Show, which premiered in January 2003. The duo wrote the sketches themselves with very little outside help.Brennan is frequently mentioned during Chappelle\u0027s stand-up routines.On an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show on February 9, 2006, Chappelle stated that Brennan made no attempt to contact him, despite the numerous media reports that Chappelle went to Africa to escape the pressures of running a high-profile show. \"How many times do you think he\u0027s called his sick buddy since he went to Africa?\",In an interview in the July 2006 issue of Maxim Magazine, when asked if he would ever work with Chappelle again, he said there was \"no chance.\"Neal Brennan was recently accused of credited for writing comedy material for the 83rd Academy Awards. In May, 2011, he wrote material for his friend Seth Meyers at the White House Correspondents dinner.Description above from the Wikipedia article Neal Brennan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

But after working as the assistant to Miguel Arteta on Chuck \u0026amp; Buck and The Good Girl, Ruben had incredible first hand access to see what directing was all about. After those experiences, Ruben quit working and spent the next two years making various low budget music videos, short films, and other experiments, thereby putting himself embarrassingly deep into credit card debt in his attempt to be a \"director.\" Luckily, people started to watch and enjoy his videos, which led to him getting signed to a production company where he was able to direct commercials and bigger budget music videos. Through making Six Days In May, a documentary about the Gumball Rally (a modern day Cannonball Run), Ruben met Rob \u0026amp; Big Black, with whom he created and developed Rob \u0026amp; Big, a hit reality television show on MTV. After three successful seasons, the show ended, only to be followed up by Rob Dyrdek\u0027s Fantasy Factory. On the feature side, Ruben directed his first feature, Zombieland, a Zom-Com about the post-apocalyptic zombie world starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.  His second film, 30 Minutes or Less, is a twisted dark comedy starring Jesse Eisenberg, Danny McBride, Aziz Ansari, Nick Swardson and Michael Pena.",

For six years she did mostly girl girl sex scenes, and hand full of golden showers and rather a large number of film appearances which were no sex at all. These were mostly during 2004 when she decided to work the other side of the camera. At the beginning of her career she married Devan Sapphire, a producer and director who she has also starred along side in a few porn flicks, and also got a couple of AVN nominations for Best New Starlet and Best All Girl Video Sex Scene. Come 2004 however, she decided that she\u0027d rather direct than be directed and started work with Digital Playground under the alias Celeste. To date she has notched up 142 titles in which she has performed and 69 that she has directed.",
